This can range from placing a business information widget in the best location to providing a sample menu with social icon links to a static front page complete with beautiful images.

Just as JavaScript is a near necessity for smoother user experiences and more modern PHP versions are critical for performance, SSL just makes sense as the next hurdle our users are going to face.</p>\n<p>SSL basically means the link between your browser and the server is encrypted. SSL used to be difficult to implement, and often expensive or slow. Modern browsers, and the incredible success of projects like <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> have made getting a certificate to secure your site fast, free, and something we think every host should support by default, especially in a post-Snowden era. Google also weighs <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html\">SSL as a search engine ranking factor</a> and will begin <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-will-soon-shame-all-websites-that-are-unencrypted-chrome-https\">flagging unencrypted sites in Chrome</a>.</p>\n<p>First, early in 2017, we will only promote hosting partners that provide a SSL certificate by default in their accounts. Later we will begin to assess which features, such as API authentication, would benefit the most from SSL and make them only enabled when SSL is there.</p>\n<p>Separately, I also think the performance improvements in PHP7 are particularly impressive, and major kudos to everyone who worked on that. We will consider whether hosts use PHP7 by default for new accounts next year as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"4588\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"WordPress 4.7 Release Candidate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-release-candidate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 04:26:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4579\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:328:\"The release candidate for WordPress 4.7 is now available.

Highlights include a <a href=\"http://2017.wordpress.net/\">new default theme</a>, video headers, custom CSS, customizer edit shortcuts, PDF thumbnail previews, user admin languages, REST API content endpoints, post type templates, and more.</p>\n<p>We’ve made <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk/src?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=39353&amp;stop_rev=39263&amp;limit=200&amp;verbose=on&amp;sfp_email=&amp;sfph_mail=\">quite a few refinements</a> since releasing Beta 4 a week ago, including usability and accessibility enhancements for video headers, media and page template support in starter content, and polishing of how custom CSS can be migrated to and extended by plugins and themes. The REST API endpoints saw a number of bugfixes and notably now have anonymous comment off by default.</p>\n<p>Not sure where to start with testing?

Or you can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.7-beta2.zip\">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>\n<p>Notable changes since WordPress 4.7 Beta 1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Twenty Seventeen:</strong> The theme wasn&#8217;t being installed on upgrades &#8211; sorry about that! Now you should see it if you&#8217;re upgrading an existing site. There are also plenty of fixes, especially for the header and small screen views.</li>\n<li><strong>Edit shortcuts:</strong> These are always visible while editing (hide them on bigger screens by collapsing the controls) and should now work properly in Firefox. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27403\">#27403</a> and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38532\">#38532</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>REST API endpoints:</strong> There have been a number of changes over the past week; your attention is requested on the following:\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>DELETE</code> response format has changed and may need to be accounted for.

than three weeks ago <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/yoast-seo-4-5-urges-users-to-upgrade-to-php-7\" target=\"_blank\">Yoast SEO version 4.5 was released</a> with an ugly, non-dismissible notice for sites on PHP 5.2. The notice encourages the user to upgrade to PHP 7, explaining that it is faster and more secure. It includes links for getting started and example emails that users can send to their hosting companies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/whip-php-notice.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In the 18 days since shipping the plugin with the upgrade nag, Yoast SEO creator Joost de Valk has seen a dramatic uptick in sites moving from old, unsupported versions to PHP 7. From December to March, PHP 5.2 usage among Yoast SEO users decreased from 1.9% to 1.7%, a modest drop over three months. After adding the nag on March 21, PHP 5.2 usage dropped from 1.7% to 1.3% for those using Yoast SEO version 4.5. PHP 5.3 usage is also steadily decreasing since de Valk began the campaign to educate his plugin&#8217;s users about the benefits of upgrading.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yoast-stats.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>According to de Valk&#8217;s stats, 22.2% of Yoast SEO users are on version 4.5 of the plugin. He estimates 1,443,000 sites on 4.5 out of 6.5 million users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Assuming 0.5% updated their PHP versions, that&#8217;s 7K sites,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;And another 14-20k that updated from 5.3 to something more decent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many developers are hesitant to implement a nag in their plugins, but Yoast SEO is one of the largest plugins to prove that an ugly, non-dismissible notice can be an effective tool for getting users to take action.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the reasons I’m sharing is because I’d love others to join us,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;People don&#8217;t like nags, but we&#8217;ve had some truly great feedback from users who went from PHP 5.2 to 7 and were astonished by how fast their sites suddenly were. Negative feedback has been absolutely minimal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Yoast SEO team created a project called WHIP that makes it easy for plugin and theme developers to add notices that will nudge their users to upgrade their software versions, starting with PHP. The project also includes a filter for linking to the WordPress.org recommended hosting page, as an alternative to the Yoast.com hosting overview.</p>\n<p>De Valk said his team intends to push the notice to users on other PHP versions in the near future, starting with 5.3.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a release coming next week (4.6), in which we won&#8217;t do it yet,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;If all goes well and continues to be mellow, 5.3 will be &#8216;nagged&#8217; as of 4.7, probably three weeks later.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 08 Apr 2017 03:56:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: Recommended Reading: Resilient Web Design, a Free e-Book from Jeremy Keith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68253\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/recommended-reading-resilient-web-design-a-free-e-book-from-jeremy-keith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5538:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/typewriter.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/4OURRGDU7Z\">Sergey Zolkin</a>\n<p>UK-based web developer <a href=\"https://adactio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremy Keith</a> published <a href=\"https://resilientwebdesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Resilient Web Design</a> as a free e-book in December 2016. Over the past few months, industry leaders have been raving about the book, so I decided to take an evening to find out what all the fuss is about. Keith has been blogging for more than 15 years at <a href=\"http://adactio.com\" target=\"_blank\">adactio.com</a>. He is an active contributor to the web standards movement, a popular conference speaker, and the author of <em>DOM Scripting</em>, <em>Bulletproof Ajax</em>, and <em>HTML5 For Web Designers</em>.</p>\n<p>After just a few pages in, I could see why so many have read Resilient Web Design all in one go. It lives up to all the excellent reviews. The book is divided into seven chapters and can be read in a couple hours. It is not a book on best practices, as one might expect, but rather a historical perspective on web standards and the evolution of responsive design. It provides a foundation for understanding technological progress and is essentially a primer on how breakthrough ideas happen and how resilient ideas endure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The World Wide Web has been around for long enough now that we can begin to evaluate the twists and turns of its evolution,&#8221; Keith said. &#8220;I wrote this book to highlight some of the approaches to web design that have proven to be resilient. I didn’t do this purely out of historical interest (although I am fascinated by the already rich history of our young industry). In learning from the past, I believe we can better prepare for the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keith&#8217;s brief history of web design recaptures some of the magic we felt at the dawn of the web. He said much of the subject matter has been included in his conference talks over the past couple of years but the book ended up taking some twists and turns that surprised him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You won’t find any code in here to help you build better websites,&#8221; Keith said. &#8220;But you will find ideas and approaches. Ideas are more resilient than code. I’ve tried to combine the most resilient ideas from the history of web design into an approach for building the websites of the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keith shares some thought-provoking ideas on design in chapter 3 that are particularly applicable to WordPress&#8217; <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle\" target=\"_blank\">new structure for releases where design and user testing will lead the way</a> in building a new editing and customization experience. The closest thing you can have to predicting the future is an understanding of what has endured in the past and an idea for building on it. Keith&#8217;s book examines principles that have proven to be resilient over time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Design adds clarity,&#8221; Keith said. &#8220;Using colour, typography, hierarchy, contrast, and all the other tools at their disposal, designers can take an unordered jumble of information and turn it into something that’s easy to use and pleasurable to behold. Like life itself, design can win a small victory against the entropy of the universe, creating pockets of order from the raw materials of chaos.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keith said he wrote Resilient Web Design for people who create websites in any capacity.

We don&#8217;t know what the web will become, but Keith&#8217;s perspective on its history brings a few resilient ideas to light. If you have some spare time over the weekend and want to be inspired about the future of the web, I highly recommend reading Resilient Web Design.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Apr 2017 20:29:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: New Userscript Restores Tabs to the WordPress Plugin Directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68488\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/new-userscript-restores-tabs-to-the-wordpress-plugin-directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2745:\"<p>One of the most common complaints about the WordPress plugin directory&#8217;s redesign is the use of read more links instead of tabs. Plugin authors and users <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-redesign-why-so-many-people-feel-their-feedback-was-ignored#comment-217002\">contend</a> that tabs make information more accessible. The redesign requires visitors to scroll a one-page design and click on various read more links to discover more information.</p>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2278\">ticket on Trac</a> that suggests a jump section be included so that visitors can jump to specific sections of a plugin&#8217;s readme file. It&#8217;s unclear if this feature will be added but if you&#8217;d like to restore the tabbed layout to the plugin directory, check out <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/scripts/nextgenthemes/Wordpress.org_Plugin_Directory_Tabs\">this Userscript</a> created by Nicolas Jonas.</p>\n<p>According <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/about/Userscript-Beginners-HOWTO\">to OpenUserJS</a>, userscripts are open source add-ons for browsers that can modify webpages as they&#8217;re loaded. Using userscripts is roughly the same as installing WordPress plugins to restore lost functionality. Jonas&#8217; userscript <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/scripts/nextgenthemes/Wordpress.org_Plugin_Directory_Tabs/source\">source code</a> contains a mix of CSS and jQuery to generate the tabs.</p>\n<p>To install the <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/scripts/nextgenthemes/Wordpress.org_Plugin_Directory_Tabs/issues\">WordPress.org Plugin Directory Tabs</a> userscript in Firefox, you&#8217;ll first need to install the free <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/about/Greasemonkey-for-Firefox\">Greasemonkey extension</a>. Greasemonkey is a Mozilla Add-on for Firefox that allows userscripts to run in the browser.</p>\n<img />Greasemonkey Firefox Add-on\n<p>Jonas developed the userscript in about 30 minutes and used CSS from a CSS button generator. The tabs have a blue background with white text on top. Jonas is open to suggestions and encourages those who want better designed buttons to <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/scripts/nextgenthemes/Wordpress.org_Plugin_Directory_Tabs/issues\">create an issue</a> with the proper CSS code on his OpenUserJS page.</p>\n<img />Tabbed Layout\n<p>I tested the userscript on Firefox 52.0.2 and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues. After navigating the plugin directory with tabs, I can easily say I prefer it versus clicking read more links. I rarely have to scroll and the information I want to see is displayed front and center. Simply put, browsing a plugin&#8217;s page with tabs is a better user experience.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Apr 2017 02:25:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Directory Restores Stats and Links to Older Versions of Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68486\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-restores-stats-and-links-to-older-versions-of-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1899:\"<p>Since the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm\">launch</a> of the newly redesigned WordPress plugin directory, the Meta team has been hard at work fixing bugs and updating the design.

After asking Alexa to enable Blog Helper, you will need to link your WordPress.com account and select the blog you want to access. Once you&#8217;re hooked up, you can say, &#8220;Alexa, ask Blog Helper for my notifications.&#8221; Alexa will read off new notifications one-by-one and mark them as read.</p>\n<p>Blog Helper also enables comment moderation with your voice, so you can take care of that while folding the laundry or doing dishes. If you ask, &#8220;Do I have any comments to moderate?&#8221;, Alexa will read them to you and you can approve, delete, or mark them as spam. Check out the quick demo video Finke created to hear it in action:</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrap\"></div>\n<p>Scientific studies have proven that <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/why-great-ideas-always-come-in-the-shower-and-how-to-h-1617303016\" target=\"_blank\">some of your best ideas come to you when your mind is relaxed and your body is distracted by routine tasks</a>. If you have an Alexa-enabled device, Blog Helper is a fun way to help you capture your creative ideas in WordPress before they get away. It allows you to create new drafts without having to pick up your phone or sit down to your desktop.</p>\n<p>Although Finke works for Automattic, he wrote Blog Helper in his free time and it doesn&#8217;t have any official affiliation with WordPress.com. His said his roadmap is to try and make as much of the core WordPress experience accessible by voice as possible. Blog Helper can be a big time-saver for those who want to manage their blogs without being tied down to a screen, but the voice interface can also be useful for those who have vision impairments.

The new settings screen has been completely rearranged under a more simplified menu.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We went through every setting on WordPress.com and Jetpack to make sure it was necessary to keep around, and to find a good, logical home for each one,&#8221; Jetpack designer Michael Arestad said. &#8220;We ended up mirroring the WordPress core settings groups for now — they are familiar to people, and things fit well there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Arestad said he was inspired by the way mobile devices handle settings, especially how they rarely include a &#8220;Save&#8221; button unless it&#8217;s an option that isn&#8217;t a simple toggle. The Jetpack design team applied this to the settings screens so that most of them are now autosaved.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/autosave.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also introduces the ability to enable the WordPress.com Toolbar, a new feature that replaces the wp-admin toolbar with the My Sites menu, a link to the WordPress.com reader, a Write button that takes you to WordPress.com, and a notifications dropdown. It is essentially the same toolbar you see when working with a WordPress.com site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jetpack-wp-com-toolbar.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Jetpack 4.8 includes several dozen improvements and bug fixes. A few of the highlights include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New MailChimp Subscribe Popup widget</li>\n<li>Sitemaps are faster and now support sites with a very large number of posts (1,000+)</li>\n<li>Contact Form now has a plain-text alternative and better avoids spam filters</li>\n<li>Debug form includes extra information to better prioritize support requests</li>\n<li>Photon can now be used within the dashboard and supports bbPress topics and replies</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Jetpack 4.8.1 Fixes PHP Incompatibility Issue</h3>\n<p>Many users reported fatal errors and blank pages after updating to Jetpack 4.8. A temporary fix was to load an older version of Jetpack. In a convenient turn of events, the WordPress plugin directory restored the ability to download older versions of plugins today (found under the new Advanced View link).</p>\n<p>Jetpack 4.8 included PHP code that is incompatible with PHP versions lower than 5.4, which caused the fatal errors. The Sitemaps module also included an incompatibility with the WP Rocket plugin. Additionally, the release included many new translation files, which caused updates not to complete on sites that have limited resources for processing large files on updates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2017/04/05/jetpack-4-8-1-php-version-incompatibility-fix/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack 4.8.1</a> was released a few hours ago to correct these issues. The Jetpack development team recommends manually installing the plugin via FTP/SFTP if your site crashed and you are unable to update through the admin.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:07:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"HeroPress: WordPress Flexibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1680\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-flexibility/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5214:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/040517-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: WordPress gives me all the flexibility I need to be constantly learning and improving.\" /><p>When I was asked to describe myself and my interests for a bio at work I floundered. I felt the same way when sitting down to write this. Where do I even begin? For my bio, I decided instead of narrowing it down I’d go with “jill-of-all-trades.” I really like to do everything and if I don’t like something I only know that because I tried it first. I’ve been this way since I can remember. At school I got good grades in everything (except Chemistry), I liked everything (except Chemistry) and I wanted to do everything. Figuring out my career path was therefore a long process (I actually started out pre-med in college, but you know&#8230; Chemistry).</p>\n<p>After graduating college I started working in marketing and absolutely hated it &#8211; I did the same exact thing almost every day. It was miserable. I missed the old web content job I had during college, where I did SEO, product photography, email campaigns, basically anything website related. Right now I can’t believe there was a point in my life that I missed HTML emails, but I did. I missed the flexibility, doing something different every day, and most importantly, I missed the creative problem solving it entailed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So I quit my stupid marketing job and attended a coding bootcamp.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was a Front End Development track where I honed my HTML and CSS skills, learned JavaScript in a few forms (vanilla, jQuery, AngularJS), and learned other tools of the trade (git, task runners, bash, etc.). When I landed my first web development job I was excited &#8211; the company did all sorts of different projects: web apps, web sites, intranets, you name it. I knew that there was enough variety to keep me constantly moving and constantly learning. My first project was something I was familiar with, an AngularJS application, but my second project was something I’d never seen before &#8211; a WordPress site. Knowing zero PHP, I dove right in.</p>\n<p>I can’t say that I loved WordPress right off the bat. When I was still mostly developing pretty simple sites with it, I was afraid it was going to become monotonous. Today I know how wrong I was. Although the majority of the projects I work with involve WordPress, I can do something new and different with every site.</p>\n<p>Just this year I’ve worked on a WordPress theme with a headless React front end, a WordPress site with part of the admin area written in React, and a WordPress plugin with a front end built in Angular 2. Even traditional WordPress themes can be exciting. Each client has their own needs and with the flexibility of templates, post types, and widgets every site I build is a new challenge.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve come a long way since drowning in monotony early in my career.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At home you might find me doing yard work, refinishing furniture, knitting, wood burning, or attempting to play the banjo. But at work, using WordPress gives me all the flexibility I need to be constantly learning and improving.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: WordPress Flexibility\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=WordPress%20Flexibility&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-flexibility%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: WordPress Flexibility\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-flexibility%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-flexibility%2F&title=WordPress+Flexibility\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: WordPress Flexibility\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-flexibility/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/040517-min-150x150.jpg&description=WordPress Flexibility\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: WordPress Flexibility\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-flexibility/\" title=\"WordPress Flexibility\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-flexibility/\">WordPress Flexibility</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Apr 2017 12:00:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Natalie Miller\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce 3.0 Brings Major Improvements to Product Gallery, Introduces CRUD Classes and a New CLI\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68232\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:119:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-0-brings-major-improvements-to-product-gallery-introduces-crud-classes-and-a-new-cli\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4330:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/woocommerce-3-0.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2017/04/woocommerce-3-0-release/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce 3.0</a> “Bionic Butterfly” was released today with significant improvements to the product gallery and developer tools. This version, which was previously going to be <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/03/13/important-update-regarding-the-upcoming-woocommerce-release-2-7-will-be-3-0-0/\" target=\"_blank\">2.7</a>, is the first major release since the plugin <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-0-0-scheduled-for-release-april-4th\" target=\"_blank\">switched to semantic versioning</a>. It was released after more than three months in beta and an extended RC testing period that allowed extension and theme developers enough time to get up to speed.</p>\n<p>The new product gallery has subtle improvements for galleries with multiple images. Clicking on a thumbnail updates the image without forcing it to open in a popup window. Galleries in 3.0 are also more intuitive on mobile with support for touch gestures, including swipe to scroll through the gallery, pinch to zoom, and swipe up to close the current image. These and several bug fixes and improvements deliver a much smoother experience of viewing product images.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrap\"></div>\n<p>This release includes significant performance improvements, thanks to the switch from post meta to taxonomies for features like product visibility, featured products, and out of stock products. WooCommerce contributors have also reduced the number of queries required to display related products and upsells.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2016/10/27/the-new-crud-classes-in-woocommerce-2-7/\" target=\"_blank\">Version 3.0 introduces CRUD</a> (Create, Read, Update, Delete) classes for developers, making it easier to write and retrieve data from the database with less code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;High order volume is one of the best problems a store can have, but it can really slow down your site’s performance,&#8221; WooCommerce lead developer Mike Jolley said. &#8220;That’s why our team’s main focus this year is performance and scalability.&#8221; Scalability improvements are planned for the next several releases.</p>\n<p>Version 3.0 also <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2016/12/12/2-7-a-new-cli-for-woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">introduces a new command line interface (CLI)</a> powered by the REST API. The previous CLI didn&#8217;t fully support the same functionality and was powered by its own separate code. The new CLI forks <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli/restful\" target=\"_blank\">Restful</a> to make REST API endpoints available as WP-CLI commands. It reduces the amount of code that WooCommerce has to maintain and ensures that the commands are always current as the project&#8217;s REST API is updated in the future.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce support forums on WordPress.org</a> have been lighting up with requests after 3.0 was released. One particular issue pinned to the top of the forums is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/3-0-error-option-ajax-is-not-allowed-for-select2/\" target=\"_blank\">an incompatibility with Select2 v3</a>. The latest version of WooCommerce uses Select2 V4 and this may cause an issue with AJAX search inputs in plugins and themes loading an older version of Select2.</p>\n<p>Another issue users are having after upgrade is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/3-0-frontend-pages-refreshing/\" target=\"_blank\">frontend pages reloading endlessly</a>, which WooCommerce developers have identified as a problem with the geolocation setting. They are working on a fix for 3.0.1.</p>\n<p>Many users who are reporting issues after updating to 3.0 have discovered incompatibilities with themes or plugins. This release received more than 3,000 commits from 115 contributors. With this many changes packed into a major release, WooCommerce developers recommend testing on a staging site and making a backup before updating the plugin. This will give you the opportunity to make sure your theme and plugins are compatible with the update.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Apr 2017 01:56:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Disconnect From Technology at Camp Press September 23-24 in Seminole, OK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68248\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/disconnect-from-technology-at-camp-press-september-23-24-in-seminole-ok\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4477:\"<p>Readers may remember in 2015, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/camppress-a-2-3-day-social-experience-for-geeks-and-creatives\">we highlighted</a> Camp Press, a conference devoted to disconnecting from technology to focus on strengthening bonds that encourage collaboration within the community.</p>\n<p>Mendel Kurland, who has spent the better part of two years organizing the event, <a href=\"https://camp.press/\">announced</a> that Camp Press will take place September 23-24, at Fry Lake in Seminole, OK. The event is a collaboration between Kurland, Aaron D. Campbell, and Christen Campbell</p>\n<p>Accommodations include tents, cabins, and RV hookups. Camp Press will take place on Camp Campbell, a plot of land owned by Campbell and his wife. Available activities include hiking, Geo-Caching, swimming, canoeing, fishing, sports, and more.</p>\n<img />A Lake Where Attendees Can Chill Out\n<p><span id=\"cch_fae57e021243ee\" class=\"_mh6 _wsc\"><span class=\"_3oh- _58nk\">&#8220;Many of us spend a lot of time online, but it’s the time we spend offline and disconnected one-on-one that’s often most important,&#8221; Kurland said. </span></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"cch_fae57e021243ee\" class=\"_mh6 _wsc\"><span class=\"_3oh- _58nk\">&#8220;Those one-on-one connections create lifelong bonds that lead to building better businesses, partnerships, and strategy. Camp Press is about fortifying those in-person bonds.&#8221;</span></span></p>\n<p>Kurland chose to host the event at Camp Campbell based on its size, number of available activities, and its remoteness.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s centrally located in the US, and remote enough to achieve the goal of disconnection. Additionally, Aaron&#8217;s family is pretty great too as it&#8217;s their land.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span id=\"cch_fae57e021243ee\" class=\"_mh6 _wsc\"><span class=\"_3oh- _58nk\">The nearest major airport is an hour away in Oklahoma City so renting a vehicle is recommended.

The guidelines state that sponsors may not wear branded gear and that advertising must be hand-made on-site.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We realize these guidelines aren’t for everyone, but we’re looking for creativity rather than corporate branding for these sponsorships,&#8221; Kurland said.</p>\n<p>Sponsorship levels range from $1,500 to $3,000 and offer various perks.</p>\n<p>Those interested in attending are encouraged to review the event&#8217;s <a href=\"https://camp.press/code-of-conduct/\">Code of Conduct,</a> which is unique compared to an event held in a physical building. For example, it has a guideline for leaving no trace:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to be involved with WordPress to attend the event. For more information and to purchase tickets, visit the <a href=\"https://camp.press/\">official Camp Press site</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Apr 2017 20:32:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WPTavern: WP-CLI Names Alain Schlesser New Co-Maintainer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68228\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-cli-names-alain-schlesser-new-co-maintainer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5640:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wp-cli.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WP-CLI has hired <a href=\"https://www.alainschlesser.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alain Schlesser</a> as a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/04/03/new-co-maintainer-alain-thanks-2017-sponsors/\" target=\"_blank\">new part-time co-maintainer</a>. The position was made possible by sponsorships from Automattic, Bluehost, DreamHost, SiteGround, WP Engine, and more than 60 individuals who contributed to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With Alain joining the project as a co-maintainer, the WP-CLI project is restoring capacity to meet current demands (e.g. support), and ramping up on new feature development and evangelization,&#8221; WP-CLI co-maintainer Daniel Bachhuber said. &#8220;We’ve already improved the build time by 33%!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schlesser first became involved in the project after Bachhuber contacted him last March for input on solving some outstanding issues with Composer, which WP-CLI uses for external package management. Schlesser said he couldn&#8217;t afford the time to actively work on the issue at that time but tried to offer meaningful input for the right angle for solving the remaining issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This short collaboration changed my perception about WP-CLI and helped me realize that there is a push to use modern and modular code to improve the tool and prepare it for future requirements,&#8221; Schlesser said. &#8220;So, already at that point, I wanted to contribute to the project. However, I was already involved in a different part of WordPress contribution (which is now the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/02/22/nextgen-bootstrap/\" target=\"_blank\">Nextgen Bootstrap/Load Feature Project</a>), and I had to prioritize my volunteer work and keep a few hours left for paid client work as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schlesser said taking on the role of a maintainer became an option once it was a paid position made possible by the project&#8217;s 2017 sponsors. Prior to that he would not have been able to financially afford the additional time investment that WP-CLI requires. The new role enables him to work for 5-10 hours per week on general user support, development of new and improved features, writing documentation, managing the issue backlog, reviewing pull requests and working on the project&#8217;s infrastructure.</p>\n<p>In joining WP-CLI as a co-maintainer, Schlesser brings a fresh perspective from developing for other platforms and years experience managing and contributing to <a href=\"https://www.alainschlesser.com/community/\" target=\"_blank\">dozens of open source projects</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP-CLI is in a unique place in terms of what it tries to achieve and how it does it (out of necessity),&#8221; Schlesser said. &#8220;For most other web platforms, the command line interface is a regular part of the core of the system itself, often building what is known as a <a href=\"http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture\" target=\"_blank\">Hexagonal Architecture</a>. WP-CLI, on the other hand, achieves most of the same benefits even though it has no direct control over the Core source code, and that source code is not meant to support such an architecture. Given the obstacles, the current results are quite an achievement!&#8221;</p>\n<p>After its 1.0.0 release, WP-CLI <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-cli-1-1-0-released-project-shifts-to-expand-package-index\" target=\"_blank\">shifted to focus on its package ecosystem</a>. New features are now built as standalone packages instead of rolling everything into WP-CLI core. The eventual goal is to better distribute the project&#8217;s maintenance burden among package maintainers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the most important change in the upcoming release is that all the bundled commands have been extracted into separate packages, and we&#8217;re currently in the process of getting rid of all the issues that this move has uncovered,&#8221; Schlesser said. &#8220;So, when it comes to making WP-CLI easily extensible and improving the tools and interfaces, we&#8217;re now eating our own dog food. In the longer term, I expect this change to have a significant impact on the onboarding experience for developers who want to create their own commands.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During his years contributing to open source projects, Schlesser said he has become well-acquainted with the unique challenges and emotional toll of maintainership, a topic that <a href=\"https://danielbachhuber.com/2016/06/26/my-condolences-youre-now-the-maintainer-of-a-popular-open-source-project/\" target=\"_blank\">Bachhuber has spoken about in the past</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maintenance of a popular open source project is at the intersection of the hard logic of technology and deeply human group dynamics,&#8221; Schlesser said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve become more aware of all the difficulties that come with such a role, but I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily state that I know anything more now on how to navigate around them. What I know for sure is that it is a burden that should be shared amongst several people when at all possible. It comes with constant pressure and churn, and doing this work as a single person puts both the project and the person at risk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schlesser plans to keep an eye out for any avoidable friction points in hopes of making the experience of maintainership as smooth as possible for all involved.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Daniel has already done a great job with this, and I can&#8217;t wait to see where the project will take us as a team,&#8221; Schlesser said.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Apr 2017 17:19:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"BuddyPress: 2016 BuddyPress Survey Results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=265117\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://buddypress.org/2017/04/2016-buddypress-survey-results/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18896:\"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-265189\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/04/bp-countries-2016.png\" alt=\"61 country flags of survey participants\" width=\"765\" height=\"490\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Thank you!</h2>\n<p>This report presents the results from the 2016 BuddyPress Survey held from November 1 through December 31, 2016. Three hundred and two (302) respondents from 61 countries completed the survey and provided valuable and interesting feedback. Many thanks!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Survey Design/Method</h2>\n<p>The survey contained 36 questions geared towards <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/priorities-for-the-next-12-months/\">Site Builders and WordPress Developers</a>. Adjusting to this more focused target audience compared to previous years&#8217;, I selected some questions from our BuddyPress <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2013/09/2013-buddypress-codex-survey-results/\">2013</a>, <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2014/03/2014-buddypress-survey-results/\">2014</a> and <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2015/05/2015-buddypress-survey-results/\">2015</a> Surveys, combined/split/modified some of the questions, and added 15 new questions. The survey was designed to maximize responses and get snapshots of:<br />\n&#8211; basic demographic information<br />\n&#8211; versions of WordPress, BuddyPress, bbPress, and PHP used<br />\n&#8211; the types, languages, number of members in BP sites<br />\n&#8211; comfort levels with BuddyPress, BP theme compatibility, and BP Hooks<br />\n&#8211; development practices and tools<br />\n&#8211; respondents willing to share their BP use cases<br />\n&#8211; BuddyPress participation and contributions<br />\n&#8211; comments about BuddyPress, BP theme/plugin development, and the survey.</p>\n<p>The questionnaire was finalized after incorporating the feedback on the draft from the BP Lead/Core Developers last year. The survey was then promoted via Twitter, BP support forums, bpdevel.wordpress.com, and survey banners added by <a class=\"bp-suggestions-mention\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/johnjamesjacoby/\" rel=\"nofollow\">@johnjamesjacoby</a> at https://buddypress.org and https://codex.buddypress.org which helped a lot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Key Findings</h2>\n<p>This section shows some of the highlights from the survey with short comments about each.

The Raspberry Pi Foundation <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ten-millionth-raspberry-pi-new-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">sold its ten millionth Pi</a> last year and just released the Pi Zero W in February 2017 with built-in WiFi and Bluetooth.</p>\n<p>If you are among the millions of Raspberry Pi owners who like to tinker with software, check out Automattic&#8217;s new <a href=\"https://inabox.blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Blog in a Box</a> project. It currently offers the easiest way of installing WordPress onto a Raspberry Pi.</p>\n<p>Although RaspberryPi.org has documentation for <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/lamp-web-server-with-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">how to run WordPress as a local website on your Raspberry Pi</a>, its recommended method requires you to install and configure Apache, PHP, and MySQL to create a LAMP web server.</p>\n<p>Blog in a Box makes it simpler with a GUI <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-installer\" target=\"_blank\">installer</a> that puts everything you need for installing WordPress onto an SD card. It comes bundled with PHP7, Nginx, and the latest version of WordPress. It automatically installs the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">Blog In A Box WordPress plugin</a>, which provides an interface for the Blog In A Box CLI tool and widgets for SenseHAT readings. It also includes a full Node development environment. The project&#8217;s creators call it &#8220;a complete system for interfacing Pi hardware with WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Blog in a Box enables users to publish data captured by the Raspberry Pi camera and SenseHAT, like photos or temperature readings, to a WordPress site that can be accessed on your local network at bloginabox.local. It is not yet capable of publishing to the web, but John Godley, an Automattic developer who worked on the project, said the team is open to adding this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of the fun of a Pi is having this device in front of you that you can play and experiment with, and we wanted to have WordPress running right there inside the Pi too &#8211; it really is a blog in a box!&#8221; Godley said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We hope that having it local will encourage people to tinker with WordPress and use it to learn programming, or to run experiments in classrooms.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are currently no live examples of blogs on the web that are receiving posts from a Raspberry Pi. However, fellow Automattic developer and Pi enthusiast Nick Momrik has created a device called <a href=\"https://nick.blog/2017/03/14/blog-in-a-box-paparazzi/\" target=\"_blank\">Blog in a Box Paparazzi</a> that extends the project with additional sensors to take a photo when anyone walks past it. His circuit diagram and a full list of sensors and other electronic components are available on <a href=\"https://github.com/nickmomrik/biab-paparazzi\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. It&#8217;s one example of how Blog in a Box can be used as a base for other fun use cases.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/paparazzi-fritzing.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: Nick Momrik &#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/nickmomrik/biab-paparazzi\">Blog in a Box Paparazzi GitHub repo</a>\n<p>Although the project doesn&#8217;t come packaged with functionality that would allow it to work as a livecam, Godley said it&#8217;s certainly a possibility.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We created a system to make it easy to interface the Pi hardware with WordPress &#8211; there&#8217;s a plugin and a set of server tools that are all extensible,&#8221; Godley said. &#8220;With a bit of work a livecam system could be added. If you add the sensor mentioned above you could livestream your cat whenever it’s nearby. Add some different sensors and you can see what affects a plant’s growth in a biology experiment and have the data ready to be viewed through WordPress, add a touchscreen and you have an interactive WordPress-powered display.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since the system uses the REST API internally, Godley it wouldn&#8217;t be difficult to configure it to send data to a remote WordPress site. The team has looked at the possibility of doing this and may revisit it in the future if there&#8217;s enough interest.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Making it really easy to set up was a primary aim &#8211; we didn’t want people to have to setup MySQL and web servers and all the complexities involved in connecting this to Pi sensors. Just a few clicks and a fully working system is copied to an SD card,&#8221; Godley said. &#8220;Once you boot your Pi it appears on your local network and can be used immediately.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The site runs on the local network but the box ensures that WordPress and its plugins stay updated. The ability to run the box without an internet connection is one of the main advantages of Blog in a Box.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The fact you can run it without an internet connection means it can be used in situations where a remote WordPress may not be appropriate &#8212; in your home, in schools, etc,&#8221; Godley said. &#8220;If someone <a href=\"https://astro-pi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">sends WordPress into space on a rocket</a>, then we’d love to hear about it!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The project is an exciting example of how WordPress can be deeply integrated with various hardware components to automatically capture and publish environmental data in a way that&#8217;s easy to view. Godley and his team at Automattic hope that <a href=\"https://inabox.blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Blog in a Box</a> will put WordPress into the hands of more like-minded tinkerers. The entire project, including the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-installer\" target=\"_blank\">installer</a>, the companion WordPress <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-theme\" target=\"_blank\">theme</a>, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a>, are all open source.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As well as people connecting the real world to their Pi, we hope that just having a full web development environment ready to go will encourage people to tinker with WordPress and try out programming or theming,&#8221; Godley said.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Apr 2017 21:34:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"HeroPress: HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=1675\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://heropress.com/heropress-geography-middle-east/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3588:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"444\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/heropress_middle_east-min-1024x474.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"HeroPress pins on a google map in the Middle East\" /><p>For a while now I&#8217;ve been thinking about how to best leverage older content on HeroPress.

This week I chose the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy!</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-to-become-a-reputable-wordpress-developer-on-your-own/\">How to Become a Reputable WordPress Developer, on Your Own!</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/growing-through-wordpress/\">Growing Through WordPress</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/ambition-persistence-self-motivation/\">Ambition, Persistence, and Self-Motivation</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/blogging-solopreneurship-terrorism/\">Blogging, Solopreneurship, &#038; Terrorism</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=HeroPress%20Geography%3A%20The%20Middle%20East&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fheropress-geography-middle-east%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fheropress-geography-middle-east%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fheropress-geography-middle-east%2F&title=HeroPress+Geography%3A+The+Middle+East\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/heropress-geography-middle-east/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/heropress_middle_east-min-150x150.png&description=HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/heropress-geography-middle-east/\" title=\"HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/heropress-geography-middle-east/\">HeroPress Geography: The Middle East</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 01 Apr 2017 13:42:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WPTavern: WordPress Community Support Shuts Down WordCamp Netherlands in Favor of City-Based WordCamps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68144\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-support-shuts-down-wordcamp-netherlands-in-favor-of-city-based-wordcamps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10904:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wordcamp-netherlands.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The application for WordCamp Netherlands 2017 has been denied. The camp, which held its sixth edition in Utrecht last year with more than 425 attendees, was one of the most well-established WordPress events in Europe. Yesterday lead organizer Marcel Bootsman published a <a href=\"https://nl.wordpress.org/team/2017/03/30/het-einde-van-wordcamp-the-netherlands/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the Dutch WordPress community site to explain why the camp has been cancelled.</p>\n<p>Bootsman&#8217;s post is written in Dutch but includes correspondence in English between the WCNL team and WordPress Community Support (WCS), formerly WordCamp Central. WCS is now pushing for all WordCamps to be city-based with the exception of regional camps, such as WordCamp US and WordCamp Europe, where the cities already have their own camps and do not prevent or detract from local communities launching their own camps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamp Netherlands has been held 6 times to date and&#8230;It has not inspired any local WordCamps (in fact, I think it’s probably fair to say that local camps have not been happening because people don’t see a need for them with the country-wide camp happening each year) and, with the exception of Nijmegen, which is still in the pre-planning phase, no cities in the Netherlands have their own WordCamps,&#8221; a WCS representative said. &#8220;With that in mind, we feel that the time has come for your community to move from the country-wide camp to running local camps. This has started happening with Nijmegen already and can easily start happening more with WordCamps in Utrecht, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and other cities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Netherlands is <a href=\"http://mapfight.appspot.com/nl-vs-us.md/netherlands-maryland-us-size-comparison\" target=\"_blank\">roughly the size of Maryland</a>, or twice the size of New Jersey, in terms of land space. One can drive across the country in two hours or less. The WCNL team contends that a country-wide WordCamp makes sense for geographical reasons and because of the locations of the organizers. The country already has an active meetup culture with 13 different meetups hosting an average of 100 attendees per event. Organizers do not see the need to have multiple smaller WordCamps fill the role that the local meetups are already doing.</p>\n<p>In response to the reasons WCNL organizers&#8217; outlined for not shutting down their event, the WCS representative replied, &#8220;I don’t think there’s really any benefit to responding to all of your points in the last email individually.&#8221; WCS reiterated its decision regarding the camp:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will not be approving WordCamp The Netherlands 2017. We would like to see city-based WordCamps happening around the Netherlands – Nijmegen being a great start to that process.</p>\n<p>We’re confident that with the space that WCNL filled being vacated, we will see some of the meetup organizers around the country stepping up to fill that space for their local communities. The local city camps may be smaller, but in many ways that can be a much better than a single large camp.</p>\n<p>As I said before, we would be happy to look at doing WCNL again in a couple of years time once there are a few city-based camps around the country happening regularly. In that case, however, WCNL would be there to complement, and not replace, the city-based camps.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordCamp Netherlands was the last remaining exception to this new rule that drops country-wide WordCamps in favor of city-based camps. The Dutch community and many of its supporters are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/roytanck/status/847365810506969089\" target=\"_blank\">now</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jrf_nl/status/847470162496241664\" target=\"_blank\">in</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nielsvr/status/847384382541148161\" target=\"_blank\">an</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mchaste/status/847374014414704645\" target=\"_blank\">uproar</a> over the decision and organizers are at a crossroads. They can choose to rebrand the event as WordCamp Utrecht, with significant drawbacks, or move forward with an independent country-wide event without the use of WordCamp tools, branding and trademarks, or funding from the Global Community Sponsorship Program.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Netherlands Conflict Highlights Cultural Differences Between the U.S. and Europe</h3>\n<p>Marcel Bootsman, who heads up the 13-person WordCamp Netherlands organization team, said they have been working since late December 2016 on the upcoming event. The team had added eight new members after the event grew 68% from 2015 to 2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everybody was thrilled to start, and the news that we could not continue hit us hard,&#8221; Bootsman said. &#8220;We have officially stopped and I have thanked everyone for their enthusiasm and support, which was difficult because I wanted to let these people feel what it is to organize an event and see happy faces all over the place.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress developer and Dutch community member Juliette Reinders Folmer said she doesn&#8217;t believe that more than one or perhaps two city-based WordCamps will get started in the Netherlands. Organizing a WordCamp is not an easy endeavor with a small pool of local organizers and volunteers. Folmer notes that since the WordPress Foundation doesn&#8217;t allow for compensating speakers for their out-of-pocket costs, the speaker pool is further limited.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A trend I&#8217;ve spotted over the last few years is that &#8216;local&#8217; WCs will have a mix of local, national and international speakers,&#8221; Folmer said. &#8220;While national speakers might still be prepared to go out of pocket, the only international speakers who can afford to do this are the ones who are sponsored by big companies which pay their travel and time to speak at those WCs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Instead of creating a larger speaker group with new and interesting voices, we&#8217;re ending up with a corporate uniform message where the more innovative and sometimes dissident voices are few and far between. By forcing WCNL to break up into smaller more local groups, this trend will become even more persistent and insidious as the demands on the limited group of national speakers will increase unless they have corporate sponsoring. Even they will not able to afford the time and costs to attend and speak at the various local WCs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Remkus de Vries, WordCamp Netherlands lead-organizer from 2009 to 2015, said the team has worked for years to see the local communities come together, and have seen people get involved with translations, forum moderation, and local meetups after attending the WordCamps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our idea from the get go for WordCamp Netherlands was to be as inclusive as possible, to unite the scattered Dutch WordPress community,&#8221; de Vries said. &#8220;The Dutch community consisted of little islands that didn&#8217;t really connect at all. We&#8217;ve been working very hard to unite our Dutch Community via WordCamp Netherlands and it was working perfectly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because of our inclusive approach we started getting international visitors and speakers from the early start as well, but more importantly, the event, as a national event, pulled everyone in from all corners of the Netherlands. Our community started and flourished because we started as a central entity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bootsman is not optimistic about the future of the Dutch WordPress community after receiving the decision from WCS. The conflict has highlighted a key difference between U.S. and European cultures when it comes to traveling. Whereas Americans might think a 4-5 hour drive to another city is a short road trip, Europe&#8217;s population is much more dense than the U.S. and traveling several hours to another city is not common.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When there is no WordCamp Netherlands, my personal belief is that this will break up the community,&#8221; Bootsman said. &#8220;Of course we will have central tools like Slack, nl.w.org and other ways to communicate, but that is nothing compared to an event where all these people can meet. People are busy and can&#8217;t find time to visit multiple WordCamps in the Netherlands. Distances are not that large in NL, that is not an issue, but time is. When you have a central WordCamp The Netherlands once a year you plan, so you are available to go. In the new situation, when there is a WordCamp Rotterdam, why visit a WordCamp in another town? This maybe hard to understand, but this is how it works for Dutch people. We&#8217;re too practical sometimes, and in this situation, it will not help the community.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Netherlands Organizers are Considering Hosting an Independent Event</h3>\n<p>Both de Vries and Bootsman are said they do not believe rules that make sense for the U.S. should be applied universally. They would prefer them to be guidelines that communities can follow or depart from if they express their preference for a country-wide WordCamp. WordPress communities in other countries like Denmark, Croatia, and Switzerland have expressed similar frustrations with the U.S.-centric rules.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamp Netherlands was what started the local WordPress meetups and ended up being the glue between the WordPress Meetups,&#8221; de Vries said. &#8220;Forcing us to stop using WordCamp Netherlands is going to impact that as you could see by the outpouring of reactions yesterday on Twitter and Facebook. Renaming WordCamp Netherlands to WordCamp Utrecht, as suggested by many, could be a solution, but nobody of the organizing team lives in the city which means, per the WCS rules, we can&#8217;t do that. But more importantly, we would be losing &#8216;our glue.&#8217; We feel that our efforts of the last years have just been flushed down the toilet with this &#8216;one-size-fits-all&#8217; rule.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although WCNL organizers were told in no uncertain terms that their camp is cancelled, a recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/03/30/wordcamp-netherlands-today-the/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the Community team blog indicates that representatives are considering feedback on the decision.</p>\n<p>The first two WordCamp Netherlands were not under the umbrella of WordCamp Central, and de Vries said they will find a way to have the camp if it comes to that. Organizers are currently examining their options.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is too soon to announce things about this but let me say that we feel the Netherlands needs to have a countrywide WordPress event based on the experiences of the last years,&#8221; Bootsman said. &#8220;We are not going to let the Netherlands WordPress community down.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 23:39:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Directory Redesign: Why So Many People Feel Their Feedback Was Ignored\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68135\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-redesign-why-so-many-people-feel-their-feedback-was-ignored\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15523:\"<p>Earlier this week, the WordPress plugin directory <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm\">relaunched</a> with a new design and an improved search algorithm. Feedback has been rolling in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm#comments\">from Tavern readers</a> and members of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1446257985436411/?match=cGx1Z2luKyBkaXJlY3RvcnkscGx1Z2luIGRpcmVjdG9yeSxwbHVnaW5z\">Advanced WordPress Facebook group</a>.</p>\n<p>The improvements to search has received a number of positive comments in addition to people requesting the ability <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm#comment-216693\">to sort results</a>. The responsive design and aesthetics of the page have also received praise.</p>\n<p>There are a number of items that plugin developers and users have reported as downsides to the new design. Some of the most notable include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin stats are only available to the plugin author by logging into the admin.</li>\n<li>Tabbed layout was replaced with a series of Read more links.</li>\n<li>Plugin banner images are distorted.</li>\n<li>The Installation tab which provided instructions on how to install the plugin is gone.</li>\n<li>Screenshots do not open in a lightbox, but open on a new page instead.</li>\n<li>Links to download older versions of plugins is missing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many of the issues reported above are known and have been known for months. While it may seem like a lot of people are <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm#comment-216738\">suddenly complaining</a> and didn&#8217;t participate in the feedback loop, it&#8217;s important to look back to see how the plugin directory redesign reached this point.</p>\n<h2>From Prototypes to Open Beta</h2>\n<p>In May 2016, the WordPress Meta team <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-meta-team-publishes-prototypes-of-the-plugin-directory-redesign\">published prototypes</a> of a new design for the WordPress plugin directory. The announcement generated <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/05/19/plugin-directory-prototypes/\">abundant feedback</a> with a strong push towards adding data instead of removing it.</p>\n<p>Many users <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/05/19/plugin-directory-prototypes/#comment-8151\">reported</a> that moving the plugin author, last updated, and active install information from the plugin&#8217;s listing page to the plugin&#8217;s details page was a downside. Samuel Sidler, Apollo Team Lead at Automattic, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/05/19/plugin-directory-prototypes/#comment-8154\">responded</a> to the feedback explaining why he didn&#8217;t think showing the information to users was useful.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Author, as you said, is only really useful for insiders. The latter two, meanwhile, are already taken into account in the search results. If a plugin doesn’t have a recent compatible version, it will move down the list. If it’s too old, it won’t get shown at all (which is the case today).</p>\n<p>Active installs is more interesting, but we account for it weighting search results as-is. I actually find it refreshing to <em>not</em> show the active installs as it allows for less-popular plugins to get more downloads. Users will be less likely to click the popular plugins (outside of familiar names) and more likely to find the plugin they actually need.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There was also a lot of discussion on how to improve and display search results.</p>\n<p>In June 2016, at WordCamp Europe, Konstantin Obenland, WordPress core contributor, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-directory-now-in-open-beta\">announced</a> that the WordPress plugin directory redesign was in open beta. The team received feedback from Matt Mullenweg, co-creator of the WordPress project, on changing the direction and design of the page. “We’re really just at the beginning of design iterations,” Obenland said. “He thinks we can do better, which he’s right about. We can and we should.”</p>\n<p>Kevan <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-directory-now-in-open-beta#comment-185077\">commented on the open beta</a> and pointed out many of the same issues that were reported with the prototypes. In July 2016, Obenland <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/07/12/plugin-directory-v3-open-beta/\">announced</a> version three of the open beta. The use of Read more links in favor of the tabbed interface was again <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/07/12/plugin-directory-v3-open-beta/#comment-8400\">brought up</a> in the comments by John Blackbourn.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m really concerned about the liberal use of &#8216;Read more&#8217; links on individual plugin pages,&#8221; Blackbourn said. &#8220;They’re being used in order to fix the information overload problem caused by placing all the information onto one page, instead of using the tabbed interface of the current directory.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In response to Blackbourn, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/07/12/plugin-directory-v3-open-beta/#comment-8413\">Joy stated</a> that the issue of Read more links had already been discussed and that the feedback was ignored. The feeling of being ignored was also shared <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/07/12/plugin-directory-v3-open-beta/#comment-8476\">by Jon Brown</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s hard to see feedback has been heard and in this case a lot of it doesn’t seem to have been taken into account (bring back tabs, no read more…).&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;I don’t see everything, or even much, so I could have certainly missed it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mika Epstein <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/07/12/plugin-directory-v3-open-beta/#comment-8418\">responded</a> that the feedback was not ignored and that Obenland was in the process of collecting and collating information.</p>\n<p>Four months ago, Kenshino <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2328\">created a ticket</a> on WordPress Meta that outlined usability concerns with using Read more links instead of tabs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Clicking on <span class=\"searchword0\">Read</span> <span class=\"searchword1\">more</span> &#8211; say on the change log requires me to scroll to the bottom before I&#8217;m able to reach the next section,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Essentially for me to go through all the sections, provided that they are long enough, I&#8217;d have to click, scroll a few pages, click, scroll a few pages etc until I get through all the sections.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The ticket was closed as a duplicate of <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2278\">Greg Ross&#8217; ticket</a>. In it, he suggests a Jump section be added so users can navigate to specific sections of the Read Me without having to scroll through the entire page. The ticket has received minor support and recently had its milestone changed from version three to a future version.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Contributors Feel Ignored</h2>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1490824833904957\">meeting held earlier this week</a> in the WordPress Meta Slack channel, Matt Cromwell, Head of Support and Community Outreach at WordImpress, <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1490825538070889\">suggested</a> that the Meta team describe the process of collecting and acting on feedback in as much detail as possible in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2017/03/30/announcing-the-new-wordpress-plugin-directory/\">announcement post</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve chatted with a lot of developers and many feel like they provided actionable feedback about the direction of the plugin directory and all advice was ignored,&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;Whether or not that&#8217;s an accurate assessment, it&#8217;s a real feeling that is shared by many. I&#8217;ve been here most weeks and know well that feedback was received and acted on, but there&#8217;s still a strong perception.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the concerns of using Read more links brought up during every phase of the project, they don&#8217;t appear to have been addressed. Other gripes expressed by members of the community at the outset of the redesign have largely remained. It&#8217;s no wonder that so many people feel like they&#8217;ve been ignored.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1490826336242943\">commented</a> in the meeting saying he, too, felt ignored, &#8220;For what it&#8217;s worth, I feel like my feedback was ignored as well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hope we can do another major iteration on the directory, because I’m not really a fan of the new one.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Perhaps the WordPress backend will make it easier to make incremental improvements in the future, as being on bbPress before was often cited as the reason things were slow to iterate previously.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although Mullenweg&#8217;s feedback in June 2016, was not public, his recent comments indicate not much has changed between then and now.</p>\n<p>Alex Shiels, a member of Team Apollo at Automattic, <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1490826698320557\">says</a> user feedback wasn&#8217;t ignored. &#8220;It’s not that anyone’s feedback has been ignored; just that we’ve had limited resources and a big back-end component to the project, and a lot of conflicting requests&#8221; he said. &#8220;I’ll make sure to give a clear invitation to provide feedback in the announcement post, and include something about future iteration.</p>\n<h2>The Inability to Measure the Impacts of the Redesign</h2>\n<p>Kevin Hoffman, who participated in discussions on trac about <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1828\">how to display screenshots</a>, asked if there was any user data and feedback that the Meta team could share that led to some of the decisions and changes that were made. For example, changes to the UI or how often the Read more links are clicked. Shiels <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1490826026176187\">responded</a> that the team does not have that data because they don&#8217;t have the tools to do it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is Google Analytics tracking, but access is very limited and from what I’ve seen of it (I don’t have direct access) it’s messy and hard to draw objective conclusions from,&#8221; Shiels said. &#8220;I absolutely agree that analytics and A/B testing would be great, but we just don’t have the tools for it right now. I think that needs to be considered a next step, but a separate project by itself really.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hoffman stepped back from contributing to the redesign after receiving <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1828#comment:41\">this response</a> seven months ago from Sidler on Trac where he says much of the feedback received was from plugin developers and not representative of users.</p>\n<blockquote><p>First, we&#8217;re building the site for users, not developers. Certainly some of our users are developers, but not the vast majority. One of the WordPress core philosophies is building first for the 80%, not the 20%, and that applies in this case as well.</p>\n<p>Second, almost all of the &#8216;overwhelming community feedback&#8217; we&#8217;ve received so far is from plugin authors who are (typically) developers. It&#8217;s all great feedback and we&#8217;re obviously listening closely. But it&#8217;s not necessarily representative of the users who visit the plugin directory regularly. We&#8217;ll certainly run user tests before launching, and we can probably run a more obvious beta, with a link from the current directory to the new one. But the directory isn&#8217;t yet ready for that.</p>\n<p>Third, this &#8216;self-imposted limitation&#8217; as you call it is not arbitrary. Rather, it&#8217;s the result of research and in-person discussion with a number of designers. Will it be the final design? I dunno. But since we haven&#8217;t tested it with real users (see the paragraph above), it&#8217;s hard to say right now. I think pursuing this direction is worthy for a number of reasons, which aren&#8217;t really worth rehashing here. First and foremost though, until we build out a product that can run through user tests, we won&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the right direction.</p></blockquote>\n<p>How can the team know that the redesign is working or is the right direction if WordPress.org doesn&#8217;t have the tools necessary to measure its impacts? There&#8217;s also the question of what data was obtained or user testing done that supports the decisions that were made? Who are these users and how does the team know what the best user experience is for them?</p>\n<h2>Iteration Is the WordPress Way</h2>\n<p>Now that the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2017/03/30/announcing-the-new-wordpress-plugin-directory/\">new directory</a> is publicly available, the Meta team is reviewing feedback, gathering bug reports, and organizing tickets on Trac.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If there are tickets that were closed or postponed during the project that you think need revisiting, then this would be a great time to start reviewing and re-opening them,&#8221; Shiels said. &#8220;We already have a bunch of tickets against the future milestone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The new directory has been built with future maintainability and iterative enhancement in mind. We’re looking forward to hearing feedback from the whole WordPress community, and making regular improvements and additions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To report a bug or enhancement with the plugin directory, you&#8217;re encouraged to <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/newticket?component=Plugin+Directory\">create a ticket on Trac. </a>If you have any questions concerning the directory or would like to get more involved, visit <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/meta/\">#meta</a> on Slack.</p>\n<h2>The Vocal Minority</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of people voicing their complaints about the WordPress Plugin Directory redesign and to <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1490897847701262\">summarize them</a> as a vocal minority is unfair.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let’s also not forget that one of WordPress’s philosophies is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#minority\">The Vocal Minority</a>,&#8221; Aaron Jorbin, WordPress core contributor, said in a conversation on the Meta Slack channel concerning feedback. &#8220;Many people being loud on the internet isn’t a reason to do anything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve documented above, the issues people are complaining about today are roughly the same as those reported during the prototype stage more than seven months ago.</p>\n<p>If months have passed and the issues brought up by members of the community who are part of the so-called vocal minority were not addressed before shipping to the public, can we blame them for complaining and feeling ignored? What about those who think that getting involved to be part of the solution was a waste of time? While the plugin directory design will undoubtedly improve with time, the complaints and concerns expressed by people this week are justified.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 23:04:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: WordPress App for Android Adds Better Support for Jetpack-Enabled Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68068\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-app-for-android-adds-better-support-for-jetpack-enabled-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1764:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wordpress-for-android.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Automattic’s mobile engineers <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2017/03/29/full-android-support-for-jetpack/\" target=\"_blank\">released a major update to WordPress for Android</a> this week. Last year the app&#8217;s users saw a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-android-5-7-adds-path-to-upgrade-wordpress-com-plan\" target=\"_blank\">growing disparity</a> between the features available to self-hosted sites and those available to WordPress.com users. Not having the WP REST API in core was holding the app back from providing the same site management features that WordPress.com site owners already enjoy. The upcoming release narrows that gap with better support for Jetpack-enabled sites.</p>\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress sites owners will now have access to People Management, Site Settings, and Site Icons in the app. A complete re-write of the app&#8217;s network layer brings more performance improvements to Stats and other features.</p>\n<p>The Jetpack blog <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2017/03/29/full-android-support-for-jetpack/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the release but doesn&#8217;t mention that these features are not yet available to all users. If you manage a self-hosted site on your mobile device, you&#8217;ll need to wait until version 7.0 hits the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android\" target=\"_blank\">Google Play Store</a>. According to Automattic mobile engineer Maxime Bias, version 7.0 is currently in staged rollout and not all users can update to get it yet. He said 7.0 should be fully rolled out soon but could not give an ETA.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 19:53:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Community Team Releases Plugin That Displays WordPress Events Nearby\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67925\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/community-team-releases-plugin-that-displays-wordpress-events-nearby\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3309:\"<p>Two weeks ago, I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/how-to-view-upcoming-wordcamps-in-the-wordpress-dashboard\">highlighted a WordPress plugin</a> that displays upcoming WordCamps in the Dashboard. I&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/03/23/showing-upcoming-local-events-in-wp-admin/\">recently discovered</a> that the WordPress Community team is working on an official plugin that does something similar called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nearby-wp-events/\">Nearby WordPress Events</a>.</p>\n<p>The plugin attempts to detect a user&#8217;s location and displays upcoming events within the WordPress News dashboard widget. Events include WordCamps and <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/topics/wordpress/\">Meetups</a> from Meetup.com. If the location detected is incorrect, users can click the pencil icon and change it to their city and state.</p>\n<img />Nearby WordPress Events Dashboard Widget\n<p>The bottom of the widget includes links to the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">WordPress Meetups landing page</a>, WordCamp schedule, and the official WordPress news blog. If your site has multiple users, each one can configure the widget to display events near their locations.</p>\n<p>According to Ian Dunn, the API includes any meetups that are within a 100 kilometer radius. For WordCamps, the radius is 350 kilometers.</p>\n<p>Here is what the radius looks like for WordPress Meetups.</p>\n<img />US WordPress Meetup Radius\n<p>Here is what the radius looks like for WordCamps.</p>\n<img />US WordCamp Radius\n<p>The distances can not be modified but, depending on feedback, they can be increased to be more accommodating.</p>\n<p>WordCamp data is gathered using an <a href=\"https://api.wordpress.org/events/1.0/\">API endpoint on</a> WordPress.org. The initial HTTP request is performed asynchronously so it doesn&#8217;t affect page loading times. The response is cached for 12 hours to avoid making unnecessary requests.</p>\n<p>The WordPress Community team created the plugin to generate more awareness of WordPress events.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The community that has been created around WordPress is one of its best features, and one of the primary reasons for its success, but many users are still unaware that it exists, and aren’t taking advantage of all of the resources that it makes available to them,&#8221; Dunn said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Inviting more people to join the community will help to increase its overall health, diversity, and effectiveness, which in turn helps to ensure that WordPress will continue to thrive in the years to come.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We think that wp-admin is the perfect place to display these events, because that’s the place where almost all WordPress users are visiting already. Instead of expecting them to come to us, we can bring the relevant information directly to them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I tested the plugin on WordPress 4.8 Alpha and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues. Users can report bugs on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nearby-wp-events\">plugin&#8217;s support forums</a> or create an issue on the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/nearby-wordpress-events/issues\">project&#8217;s GitHub page</a>.

The redesign spent more than six months in beta for feedback and testing, but many contributors on the project said they felt their feedback was not taken into account. The result is that the new design shipped but has not been well received by the community. Most users and developers welcome the changes to the search algorithm, but the new UI for the plugin pages has received quite a bit of negative feedback.</p>\n<p>One of the unpopular changes made during this refresh was the removal of individual plugin stats, which can now only be viewed by plugin admins. The decision may be temporary but depends on feedback from users.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you&#8217;re missing plugin stats after the redesign, check out the new <a href=\"http://wpstats.me/\" target=\"_blank\">wpstats.me</a> site. WordPress plugin developer <a href=\"https://wpartisan.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Edward Dakin</a> created it in just a few hours using the WordPress.org API&#8217;s. Visitors can enter a plugin&#8217;s slug and see recent and all-time download stats.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wpstats.me_.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I like checking out plugin stats, seeing which are popular, how others are doing, etc, so I put together a quick something to do that and thought others might find it useful,&#8221; Dakin said. WPstats.me is essentially a one-page app so Dakin opted to host it on GitHub pages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The CSS is done with <a href=\"http://tachyons.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Tachyons</a> (I’m super into function CSS at the moment), the JS is Backbone for the routing, jQuery for the ajax stuff, and Underscore for the templating,&#8221; Dakin said. He said the hardest part of putting the site together was finding the WordPress.org APIs, as the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> is sparse and out of date.</p>\n<p>If the Meta team decides to bring stats back into the plugin page design, Dakin said he will consider leaving WPstats.me up anyway if people are finding it useful. Some users like to see how stats have changed over time and developers appreciate being able to check up on their competition.</p>\n<p>As a WordPress.org plugin developer, Dakin is directly affected by the changes to the directory. He is considering changing how he markets his plugins and is hoping for improvements to the UI that was shipped this week.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I like the improvements to the search a lot,&#8221; Dakin said. &#8220;In terms of the page redesign I like that they’re trying, but I don’t think it’s quite there yet. Like many others, I feel that the collapsing sections is a bit of a poor use of space. And yes, I haven’t done anything yet but I will be experimenting with restructuring plugin readme&#8217;s so the important points are immediately visible and not hidden on page load.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 19:12:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"WPTavern: WordPress Polyglots Team Calls for Volunteers to Organize Global Translation Day Three\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68066\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-polyglots-team-calls-for-volunteers-to-organize-global-translation-day-three\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2111:\"<p>The WordPress Polyglots team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2017/03/29/global-wordpress-translation-day-3-call-for-organisers/\">asking for volunteers</a> to help organize <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Global Translation Day Three</a>.

Joe Guilmette, team lead at <a href=\"http://www.wpallimport.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WP All Import</a>, opened up Poopy.life to the public today, offering free unlimited WordPress installs for anyone who needs a temporary site.</p>\n<p>After verifying that you&#8217;re not a robot, Poopy.life creates a test install and sends you to the admin where you can see credentials for logging in and sharing the site. The install expires after a week, unless manually extended with the button in the admin. It also allows you to create a sandbox template that can be shared via a URL so that others can quickly create a duplicate install.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/poopy-test-install.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The platform also has a secret menu, like <a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/eat/los-angeles/the-in-n-out-secret-menu-ranked\" target=\"_blank\">In-N-Out Burger</a>, that allows you to add URL parameters to spin up sites even faster with certain actions already taken:</p>\n<p><strong>No URL Parameters</strong><br />\n<code>http://poopy.life/create/</code></p>\n<p><strong>Copy an existing install</strong><br />\n?src=[Sandbox ID]&amp;key=[auth key]<br />\n<code>http://poopy.life/create?src=panicky-pheasant&key;=EuT9WPIm8122WCcq</code></p>\n<p><strong>Redirect URL</strong><br />\n?url=[redirect URL]<br />\n<code>http://poopy.life/create?url=/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sandbox</code></p>\n<p><strong>Send a welcome email</strong><br />\n?email=[email address]<br />\n<code>http://poopy.life/create?email=user@example.com</code></p>\n<p><strong>Activate Plugins</strong><br />\n?activate_plugins=[plugin_slug_1],[plugin_slug_2],[etc]<br />\n<code>http://poopy.life/create?activate_plugins=akismet,wordpress-importer</code></p>\n<h3>Poopy.life Platform Will Add a Commercial Tier at WPSandbox.io in the Near Future</h3>\n<p>Although Poopy.life is both memorable and amusing, the team chose the domain to prevent people from using it in their own product demos and support channels.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We chose poopy.life specifically because it is ridiculous and no one will be able to use it in a professional context,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;Also it was shorter than the previous domain we were going to use &#8211; oxygen-is-really-amazing-and-everyone-loves-it.com.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Poopy.life runs on CloudLinux and Guilmette said it is hosted on &#8220;a handful of very powerful dedicated servers and ~10 smaller helper instances/load balancers, and duct tape.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WP All Import plans to introduce a commercial tier on wpsandbox.io to allow users to have installs on a custom domain, as well as control of the welcome notice and email. The poopy.life domain and landing page will live on, but Guilmette expects that it will soon be blacklisted by Google.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress installs are real WordPress installs and you can install any plugin on them,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;You can install a PHP shell and dig around the server and run whatever weird spammy malware you want. There really isn’t any way to prevent it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Guilmette estimates that Poopy.life is powering approximately 2,000 test installs right now. He doesn&#8217;t know how many their infrastructure can handle, but said they can easily scale it up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We don’t really monitor or throttle usage so much as try to make sure that one user isn’t able to negatively impact another,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;If the service grows in popularity, there will probably be some pain points that we’ll need to address. But we’ve been doing this for a long time and have worked out many of the kinks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team has been using a version of the Poopy.life platform on <a href=\"http://www.wpallimport.com/try/\" target=\"_blank\">wpallimport.com/try/</a> and <a href=\"http://www.oxygenapp.com/try/\" target=\"_blank\">oxygenapp.com/try/</a> for several years. In addition to being a fun, free tool they could offer to the public, the platform has also been critical to the success of the company. It allows users to test WP All Import and Oxygen products before purchasing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Poopy.life is basically magical golden dogfood we’ve been eating for years,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;This platform is huge for us. Back before we got serious about this we were hosting it on a VPS at MediaTemple, just kind of hacking it together. It would go down all the time, and whenever it did it would throw our support channel into disarray and sales would drop by 50%.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Guilmette said the most important thing WP All Import customers want to know is if the product will be able to import their files. The testing platform drives sales for the company and reduces refunds and buyer&#8217;s remorse, because customers know exactly what they are getting. It also has proven to reduce support requests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We get way fewer simple questions about the UI, because people can just try it,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;So that clears support up for people who have real problems. It also makes those support requests easier, because the user can reproduce the problem on a debug install, and we can poke at it without worrying about breaking their site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Guilmette said the team is working on launching the commercial tier and may have something ready within a couple of weeks or sooner with the help of testers.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 19:36:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"HeroPress: WordPress: A Tool for Success\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1672\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-tool-success/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12379:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/032917-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I was not an obvious choice for a successful web person, but WordPress helped me reach my goals.\" /><p>I was a college teacher for most of my life. When my fourth baby arrived, I gave up a travel-heavy university job and took a “mommy job” as a bookstore manager. I chose books, held teacher workshops, and read stories to children for 15 years. As the internet became important, we put up a website and I became the manager of that site. 18 months later, the bookstore’s owners went bankrupt and closed the store.</p>\n<p>My initial reaction was, “They can’t do that – we’re #2 on Google!” We’d also gone from zero ecommerce sales to $5,000 a month. We had visitors to our blog from 192 different countries. Online, we were a success. But it was 2008, and lots of small businesses were going under. Lots of people were unemployed. I was unemployed for the first time in my life.</p>\n<p>Being #2 or even #1 on Google had a different meaning in those days, before customized search results. For me, it meant that I had become skilled with SEO and content marketing, but I figured I’d have to return to the classroom when my job ended.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We couldn’t have done this without you,” the owner of the bookstore said. “There are other businesses that would benefit from your skills. Why don’t you go into business helping them?”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I scoffed bitterly. I had kids in college and two more getting ready to finish high school. I clearly needed a higher level of security than self-employment could offer.</p>\n<p>What’s more, I had already discovered that people who found out what I did with computers invariably looked at me oddly and said, “You don’t look like a computer guy.” They were right, although we now have a much more open minded idea of what computer guys can look like. Back then, though, I looked like someone’s mom. I was someone’s mom. This caused a high level of cognitive dissonance for some people, I knew.</p>\n<p>But I was bold enough to do a little bit of helping other businesses while I looked for work. I wrote an essay at the site that was then SEOMoz and got a job offer in the comments. I picked up a couple of local clients, and then through an online marketplace found some international clients. I went to job interviews, of course, and was offered jobs managing various things. But nothing I was offered was as fun as the work I was doing online. I turned down all the offers I received.</p>\n<h3>The Web People</h3>\n<p>I clearly remember my last job interview. It was Halloween 2008. I was talking with the vice chancellor at a medical school about his online needs. This was my first IRL tech job interview and the vice chancellor had told me I was his favorite candidate. The secretary came to the door and said, “We need to take Rebecca down to the basement to meet the Web People.”</p>\n<p>She was dressed as a witch. The hallways were full of cotton spider webs and spooky decorations. She was taking me down to the basement to meet the Web People. I was the only one who laughed.</p>\n<p>You see the humor, right? They did not. I realized that I didn’t really want to go back to academia, I didn’t want to manage things, and I didn’t want to sit in a cubicle proofreading. I wanted to have fun with websites.</p>\n<p>I talked with my family about the possibility of going into business for myself, and the possibility that I could fail and limit their college choices. My youngest son said, “You’ve always done what’s best for us. You should do what’s best for you.”<br />\nI have great kids.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At that point, I reviewed my income figures, saw that I was earning twice as much as I had earned as a bookstore manager, and decided that I would carry on as an independent Web Person.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As a freelance web writer and SEO, I never met a CMS I couldn’t make friends with. If there wasn’t a CMS at a website, I used Dreamweaver. Drupal, Joomla, Mango, sticks and clay tablets, I didn’t care. I used WordPress along with all the other options my clients wanted. In 2009, after being featured in the Wall Street Journal, my freelance business boomed. I teamed up with designers and built websites in addition to writing for web designers and agencies and businesses on four continents.</p>\n<p>My eldest daughter, Rosie, saw that I needed some help and came to work with me. “Saw that I needed some help” may be too kind a way to put it. I have some useful skills, but my main goal for my business was not to starve in the gutter and my main goal for accounting was to keep out of jail. We met with the local Small Business Association rep a couple of months after Rosie joined me and he said to me, kindly but firmly, “You’d be in trouble without her.”</p>\n<p>But with Rosie as my partner, I was able to build a thriving business. In 2010 we built a WordPress site for K-12 teachers just in time for our first WordCamp. We needed a lab site, and I had just finished writing a bunch of lesson plans with the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. In the course of that project I had discovered how limited online STEM (science, tech, engineering, and math) options for K-12 teachers were. We built a website called FreshPlans to help fill that need and had a functioning WordPress site for WordCamp.</p>\n<h3>0 to 8,000 in six months</h3>\n<p>Six months later, Rosie and I were looking at the stats for FreshPlans – 8,000 visits a month – and she said, “Why aren’t we doing this for our own website? Why aren’t we doing this for all our clients?”</p>\n<p>I didn’t have a good answer for why we weren’t doing it, but we went ahead and switched our business site to WordPress. We convinced our designer to give WordPress a chance and built WordPress websites for clients who needed new sites. We saw how much more sense the websites made to our clients. We saw how much more quickly we could build the sites and how much more value we could provide for our clients without the cost of bringing in a developer. We found that we were able to streamline our process for the clients whose blogging and social media we look after. We saw impressive results for our clients, too; not every website can go from 0 to 8,000 visits in six months, but we definitely see better results with WordPress than without it.</p>\n<p>Within a year, we went from platform agnostic to a dedicated WordPress shop. It worked better for us. It worked better for the people whose sites we built and managed. We were also beginning to see the value of open source and to appreciate the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>After that first WordCamp, I spoke at a couple of camps every year and our company sponsors and helps organize a couple of WordCamps nearly every year. Last year I spoke at three and I hope to continue expanding that service. WordPress has been good to us and we want to give back to the awesome WordPress community.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Success</h3>\n<p>Our business has grown. My eldest son graduated from college and joined the family business. My second daughter left us to work for Automattic. We’ve had some rough times, as every business does, but we can be proud of the work we do.</p>\n<p>We have the privilege of working with awesome clients, both locally and around the world. They can share their brands and their bigger messages in ways that would have been difficult and costly just a decade ago. We’re able to get great results for them – with hard work and WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress is not a magic pixie dust you can sprinkle on your website for instant success.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But there are some things about WordPress that set you up for success:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It may not be true (okay, it isn’t true) that you can master WordPress with no tech skills, training, or effort. But you don’t have to be a programmer to get the results you want and need in WordPress. If you have something to say, you can get it published more easily in WordPress than with other platforms.</li>\n<li>There’s no quality tradeoff. We usually build custom websites with talented and trained designers, but I’ve built dozens myself with pre-made themes and my own HTML and CSS skills (and great photos – the secret weapon for non-artists who want to create beautiful WordPress websites). Either way, you’re not limited by WordPress as you are by drag-and-drop sitebuilding tools.</li>\n<li>Because updating and adding content is so easy with WordPress, you can accomplish the essentials of content marketing more easily. You can focus on your message with less worry about the medium. You and your Web People can shape the web experience you want for your visitors efficiently.</li>\n<li>WordPress has the most supportive community you can find. We’re friends with local companies that we could also call competitors, because we spend time together in Meetups and WordCamp organizing meetings. We also have a large network of WordPress folks we respect and admire. It’s great to see them in person at WordCamps, but we also have the opportunity to get to know them better virtually. We help them and they help us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I can say from experience that WordPress has made a big difference in my life. I’m still a mom – in fact, I’m now a grandmother. But I’m also the owner of a successful web firm and a successful educational website. I write for and care for a number of websites I can be proud of.</p>\n<p>Last year at WordCamp Kansas City a man came up to show me his new website. I had spoken the year before about how to get started with a WordPress website, and he had been able to build a site for his fantasy hockey league. He was excited to show it to me, and I was excited to see it. That capacity to help other people achieve their goals with WordPress means a lot to me.</p>\n<p>If you’re just starting with WordPress, let my story encourage you. I was not an obvious choice for a successful Web Person, but WordPress helped me reach my goals.

The app has a refreshed interface for translating .PO files, which Poedit creator Václav Slavík said was created by a professional designer. It is also the first paid upgrade for Pro users since the app <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/poedit-adds-pro-support-for-wordpress-theme-and-plugin-translation\" target=\"_blank\">added support for WordPress theme and plugin translations</a> in 2013.</p>\n<p>Poedit 2 introduces direct connectivity support for WordPress, allowing developers to connect directly to the server instead of working with unpackaged plugins/themes locally.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wordpress_connect@2x.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a><br />\n&#8220;Putting translation files on the server was the most common source of problems in Poedit (too many things can go wrong if you’re not yet very familiar with WP) and this feature should help a lot with that,&#8221; Slavík said.</p>\n<p>This release adds support for <a href=\"http://twig.sensiolabs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Twig templates</a> and <a href=\"https://upstatement.com/timber/\" target=\"_blank\">Timber</a>. In the past, users had difficulty extracting strings from Twig templates, requiring some fragile workarounds. Slavík said some users resorted to setting up Poedit to treat them as Python files. Poedit 2 has a new built-in extractor for Twig.</p>\n<p>Poedit 2 also introduces a new pre-translation feature that allows for batch pre-translation of the entire PO file at once using Poedit&#8217;s online database and machine translation. After this has processed, users can then read through and correct any errors. Slavík said this feature saves a lot of time for many WordPress-related translations, such as themes, where a lot of strings are often repeated.</p>\n<p>Poedit used to be available from the Mac App Store but is now distributed exclusively from the <a href=\"https://poedit.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Poedit.net</a> website. The latest release drops support for older operating systems and requires users to be on Windows 7 or newer, macOS 10.10 Yosemite, or a modern Linux distribution.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 01:02:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"WPTavern: Data From Theme Reviews Shows Authors Need More Education on Developing Secure WordPress Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67987\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"https://wptavern.com/data-from-theme-reviews-shows-authors-need-more-education-on-developing-secure-wordpress-themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4489:\"<p>Last week, we <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-making-progress-on-clearing-out-1000-review-backlog\">highlighted the progress</a> being made by the Theme Review Team in clearing out a 1K+ review backlog. In an effort to determine common problems with themes discovered by reviewers, Carolina Nymark, a member of the Theme Review Team, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2017/03/25/review-statistics/\">reviewed 100 tickets</a> from 531 themes that were closed and marked not approved between December and February. Nymark cautions that the data does not assure statistical accuracy and is not representative of the entire directory.</p>\n<p>Her assessment shows that the most common problems discovered by reviewers were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Missing escaping or using the wrong functions: 23 themes</li>\n<li>Text that is not translation ready: 21 themes</li>\n<li>Missing prefix: 20 themes</li>\n<li>Scripts or styles are not enqueued: 18 themes</li>\n<li>PHP notices, errors or warnings: 12 themes</li>\n<li>Style tags does not correspond with theme functionality, or are deprecated: 10 themes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nymark also reviewed 100 out of 177 new themes that went live between December and February. Out of these themes, the most common problems were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Missing escaping or using the wrong functions: 51 Themes</li>\n<li>Text that is not translation ready: 44 Themes</li>\n<li>Missing prefix: 39 Themes</li>\n<li>Missing license or copyright information for included assets: 34 Themes</li>\n<li>Unused code or files: 25 Themes</li>\n<li>PHP notices, errors or warnings: 20 Themes</li>\n<li>Missing sanitization, or using the wrong functions: 18 Themes</li>\n<li>Options in the customizer that are not working: 18 Themes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last Friday, Jose Castaneda, Ulrich Pogson, and Nymark participated in a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2017/03/27/chat-with-matt-about-the-future-of-theme-repo/\">voice chat</a> with Matt Mullenweg, co-creator of the WordPress project, to discuss the future of the theme directory. The team discussed ideas around automation, improving the theme preview experience, and content portability. One of the experiments Mullenweg proposed is to remove the manual review process and rely more on user feedback. Feedback could include, tags, reviews, and other meta data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As we are not sure if the process will function without manual reviews, we will start working on getting better user feedback on themes,&#8221; Pogson said. &#8220;Once we have a good infrastructure in place we can experiment with how the repository reacts with no manual reviews.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We discussed the process we would go about making decisions on changes to the theme repository and came to the consensus that a direct democracy is too fragile and representative democracy would be a better solution.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Security, code errors, and prefixing, were also mentioned in the conversation as the most common issues encountered with themes. The team was given a series of tasks to complete and will report the results to Mullenweg at a later date.</p>\n<h2>New Theme Check Plugin Will Detect Common Security Issues</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/about/\">Theme Handbook</a> doesn&#8217;t have a chapter on security but it does link to a series of articles on writing secure themes in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/resources/\">resources section</a>. Justin Tadlock, Key Reviewer, says work is underway on a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WPTRT/WordPress-Coding-Standards\">Theme Check</a> plugin that will automatically detect security issues commonly seen during the manual review process. These include escaping and data sanitization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we could get the greater theme developer community to pitch in and help get this finished, it would be awesome,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Even outside of WordPress.org, ThemeForest and commercial theme shops could really use this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Members of the TRT are testing the plugin behind the scenes and are working to eliminate false-positives. The best way to get involved in the project is to view the<a href=\"https://github.com/WPTRT/WordPress-Coding-Standards/issues\"> Issue tracker</a> and submit pull requests. Once the new theme check plugin is live, it will give authors another tool at their disposal for developing more secure WordPress themes.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 22:52:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: WordPress Relaunches Plugin Directory with New Design and Improved Search Algorithm\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5396:\"<p>The new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Plugin Directory</a> went live today. Contributors have been working for the past year on rebuilding the directory with a new design and better capabilities for searching through the 45K+ available plugins.</p>\n<p>The new landing page displays a search bar prominently at the top, followed by sections for featured plugins, popular plugins, and beta plugins.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wordpress-plugin-directory.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The design changes to the individual plugin pages have received <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1446257985436411/?match=YWR2YW5jZWQgd29yZHByZXNzLHdvcmRwcmVzcy5vcmcsd29yZHByZXNzLGFkdmFuY2Vk\" target=\"_blank\">mixed feedback from members of Advanced WordPress Facebook.</a> The screenshots slider and FAQ accordion UI are welcome improvements, but many are not fond of how the new single plugin display ditches the previous tabbed interface in favor of truncated sections with numerous &#8220;read more&#8221; links. This requires the visitor to click and scroll repeatedly through a massive wall of text. The experience of doing this to find information is much less efficient than the previous tabbed UI.</p>\n<p>Many of the plugin header images appear to be stretched now with the new wider content area, but this may encourage developers to update their listings. Several users have commented that they are disappointed with the removal of stats, which are now viewable for admins only. Plugin team member Mika Epstein said they are waiting for more feedback from end users (not plugin developers) on whether to make them publicly viewable again.</p>\n<p>The new design matches <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-launches-homepage-redesign\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org&#8217;s homepage redesign</a>, which went from sketches to prototype to live during the last few weeks of December 2016. The most exciting improvements, however, are found under the hood.</p>\n<p>The plugin directory is now powered by WordPress, instead of bbPress, making it easier for plugin developers and reviewers to manage plugins, tags/categories, and committers. The submission and review process has also been streamlined so the plugin team will no longer reject plugins after 7 days. They also have to ability to rename plugin slugs prior to approval for easier handling of typos.</p>\n<h3>New Plugin Search Algorithm Delivers More Relevant Results</h3>\n<p>The most significant user-facing improvement in the redesign is better search relevance. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/08/30/initial-analysis-of-plugin-search-logs/\" target=\"_blank\">Analysis of plugin search logs</a> in August 2016 showed the directory handles 100,000 searches per day and receives more than 500k unique search queries per month.</p>\n<p>Greg Ichneumon Brown, a Data Wrangler at Automattic, published an in-depth <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/03/15/improving-relevance-and-elasticsearch-query-patterns/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> on how he and contributors improved search fidelity for the new plugin directory. The eye-opening account explains just how opinionated search algorithms need to be in order to give users the best experience at this scale.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In improving the fidelity of search results, it’s not just a question of how we satisfy a single user’s search query, but how we satisfy thousands of users for each unique search term: which plugins will support that volume of users and their requests for support?&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;Which are most likely to give all of these users a great WordPress experience?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The new search algorithm delivers results based on this premise. Brown added a calculation for the lowest/highest ratio of active_installs to the number of times the search was performed. However, this isn&#8217;t the only factor that influences whether or not a users will have a good experience with the top results. The algorithm also includes signals that Brown said plugin authors have a lot more control over:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resolving support threads</li>\n<li>Keeping the plugin update to date</li>\n<li>Testing the plugin on the latest versions of WordPress</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Brown&#8217;s <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/03/15/improving-relevance-and-elasticsearch-query-patterns/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> breaks down the Elasticsearch query he developed for the directory and explains how text matching works to find relevant results for author searches, queries that include operators, and partial-word boosting.</p>\n<p>The plugin directory relaunch has several known issues that the plugin team noted in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/03/28/the-new-directory-is-mostly-live/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> today. Users are noticing many broken links, problems with SVN, and other bugs when navigating around the new directory. The team has a list of tickets on <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=reopened&status=assigned&status=reviewing&status=new&status=accepted&group=status&milestone=Plugin+Directory+v3.0\" target=\"_blank\">Meta Trac</a> that they are working through and feedback is welcome.

In an <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/26/amber-rudd-social-media-firms-must-do-stop-terror/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> published on the Telegraph Sunday morning, British Home Secretary Amber Rudd called on Google, Twitter, and Facebook to take action on extremist content. She also identified Telegram, Justpaste.it, and WordPress.com as smaller platforms through which terrorist activity is spreading.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There should be no place for terrorists to hide,&#8221; Rudd told Andrew Marr in an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04y2cnh\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a> over the weekend. &#8220;We need to make sure organizations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don’t provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last week&#8217;s attack in London also seems to have reignited the UK government&#8217;s war on encryption, as Rudd said that the security agencies&#8217; inability to crack encrypted messages during an investigation is &#8220;completely unacceptable.&#8221; Masood allegedly used WhatsApp to communicate shortly before the attack.</p>\n<p>The Home Secretary has summoned representatives from a list of online service providers, including Google, Twitter, Facebook, and smaller companies, to a meeting this week to discuss combatting terrorist abuse of these platforms. Automattic would not confirm whether the company has been summoned but it seems likely given that WordPress.com was one of the platforms Rudd highlighted over the weekend.</p>\n<p>The Telegraph article strongly linked WordPress.com to terrorism, citing several claims from the Counter Extremism Project that the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/01/how-alleged-isis-videos-are-creating-a-headache-for-wordpress/?utm_term=.bb8acba3d6ff\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> earlier this month:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But most such sites are publicly available and used to spread content. According to US think tank the Counter Extremism Project, WordPress.com sites have played host to beheading videos, firing squads, and a video of a man being shot in the head, emblazoned with the words &#8216;This In the Enemy Of Allah.&#8217;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Historically, WordPress.com has been a strong supporter of free speech but posting terrorist propaganda is a violation of its terms of service. The site has a dedicated page outlining the platform&#8217;s stance on <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/terrorist-activity/\" target=\"_blank\">terrorist activity</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>While our service is designed to enable users to freely express their ideas and opinions, however controversial, safety is important to us. As such, we don’t allow websites of known terrorist groups or genuine calls for violence against individuals or groups on WordPress.com.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress.com users can <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/report-blogs/\" target=\"_blank\">report sites</a> they find to be suspicious but the page also emphasizes the platform&#8217;s commitment to free speech:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Please note that the team behind WordPress.com strongly believes in freedom of speech. WordPress.com has a vast audience spread across many cultures, countries and backgrounds with varying values and our service is designed to let internet users freely express any ideas and opinions without us censoring or endorsing them.</p>\n<p>We take all reports seriously, but we won’t remove sites just because they are offensive.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress.com also denies use to individuals, groups, or entities on the <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sdnlist.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Specially Designated Nationals</a> list, maintained by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear what Home Secretary Rudd is calling for in summoning global tech company representatives to a meeting, but her comments on the Andrew Marr show indicate the government may request closer monitoring.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;m saying is the best people &#8211; who understand the technology, who understand the necessary hashtags to stop this stuff even being put up, not just taking it down, but stopping it being put up in the first place &#8211; are going to be them,&#8221; Rudd said. She also said she is in conversations with the U.S. government to help get all of these companies around the table to agree to stop this kind of content from being published in the first place.</p>\n<p>Automattic would not provide a comment at this time regarding its position on the UK government attempting to curb online extremism by targeting online services. However, the company has a long history of actively pushing back against requests that violate users&#8217; freedom of speech. In 2010, Automattic <a href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2010/07/01/support-the-first-amendment-with-1-for-all/\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrated its support for freedom of speech by raising awareness about the First Amendment</a>. Automattic&#8217;s General Counsel Paul Sieminski wrote about the company&#8217;s commitment to <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/striking-back-against-censorship/\" target=\"_blank\">strike back against censorship</a> in 2013 after taking to the courts to stand with users against DMCA abuse. In 2014, when tech companies all over the world joined forces to <a href=\"https://thedaywefightback.org/\" target=\"_blank\">protest NSA surveillance</a>, Automattic was among them.</p>\n<p>If Rudd&#8217;s call for tech companies to take &#8220;a more proactive role&#8221; in tackling terrorist abuse ultimately means introducing monitoring that violates users&#8217; privacy and gives government more access, she will be hard-pressed to get cooperation. American companies like Automattic and Apple have already demonstrated they are willing to go to court to protect users&#8217; freedoms and privacy.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">To help keep our streets safe, we need to rise up against companies like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash\">#Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Whattsapp?src=hash\">#Whattsapp</a> who provide space and comfort to terrorists</p>\n<p>&mdash; Nadine Dorries (@NadineDorriesMP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NadineDorriesMP/status/846267877435035648\">March 27, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The anti-encryption rhetoric surrounding this issue seems manufactured to allow UK government officials to capitalize on a public tragedy in order to push a political agenda. Rudd is unlikely to find many companies in the tech industry that are eager to hand over users&#8217; freedoms and private communications, but hopefully the summit will serve to educate government officials on why it&#8217;s dangerous to legislate backdoors into consumer products.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 22:30:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Miami 2017 Will Livestream All Sessions this Weekend\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67929\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-miami-2017-will-livestream-all-sessions-this-weekend\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1577:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wordcamp-miami-2017.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://2017.miami.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Miami</a> kicked off today with its ancillary workshops for beginners, freelancers, and BuddyPress enthusiasts.

The internet speculated freely about Medium&#8217;s next move after CEO Ev Williams said the company would be taking “a different, bolder approach” to the problem of driving payment for quality content.</p>\n<p>It turns out the &#8220;bolder approach&#8221; he referenced is a subscription-based model, one that <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/opinion/2017/03/23/ev-williams-lost-goddamn-mind/#.tnw_zZrtqFcj\" target=\"_blank\">skeptics</a> are already eager to <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/24/medium_five_bucks_a_month_for_nothing/\" target=\"_blank\">tear apart</a> as many media organizations have struggled to find success with paywalls. Early subscribers will receive access to curated content, a new reading experience, ad-free browsing, and an offline reading list. Medium will be using the subscription revenue to pay writers for content, some of which will be restricted to members only.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will be routing 100% of the revenue from founding members (those who sign up in the first few months) to writers and independent publishers who have important work to do,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;Those who have hard-won expertise, do exhaustive research, and think deeply. Those who make us all smarter. Those who maximize our understanding of the world but don’t necessarily maximize clicks — and, therefore, are at a disadvantage amongst the highly optimized algorithm chum being slung by the truckload by low-cost content purveyors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Medium&#8217;s new curated content stream will surface the most worthwhile articles from its network, which grew from 1.9 million posts in 2015 to 7.5 million in 2016 posts. Williams identified the types of content members can expect with their subscriptions in a <a href=\"https://blog.medium.com/our-approach-to-member-only-content-cfce188261d1#.ciyj1nlir\" target=\"_blank\">followup post</a> viewable only to subscribers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Politics. What’s happening behind the headlines. How to think about it. What to do about it.</li>\n<li>Work. Lessons in business, startups, leadership, management, and money.</li>\n<li>Self. Smart takes on how to be your best you — happier, healthier, more productive.</li>\n<li>Future. Where the world is going — technology, trends, what it all means.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For those who have long regarded Medium as the home of hot takes, open letters, and scintillating rants, the new curated content will feature pieces from those who Williams describes as &#8220;doing important work.&#8221; The list above indicates the platform will be promoting a hefty does of spoon-fed thought and self-improvement topics. In order to make money from the people who have it to spend, the blogging silo must focus on helping those with too much information and not enough time to figure out &#8220;how to think about&#8221; important issues.</p>\n<p>Medium is currently <a href=\"https://medium.com/@adamhodgkin/medium-needs-a-business-model-550d3e2ff2ab#.f0ld2suga\" target=\"_blank\">soliciting writers via email</a>, according to one recipient, Adam Hodgkin. This move marks a change in the company where it is essentially becoming a publisher in addition to an aggregator, commissioning content that will deliver that trademark Medium flavor.</p>\n<p>Authors should be aware that articles published behind Medium&#8217;s paywall will lose their potential to go viral. In addition to trading site and content ownership for convenience, those who agree to write for Medium&#8217;s members will be limiting the potential reach their content may have had if it was published in the open.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Media is broken,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;And we need to fix it. I’m super passionate about this. Though we’ve changed our approach recently, this has been Medium’s mission from day one. We saw the feedback loops for publishing content to be a major problem, and we set out to build a new model. We’ve come a long way since — establishing ourselves as the platform for thoughtfulness, depth, and insight from independent thinkers. But the greater challenge — changing the incentives that drive our consumption of media online — has become even more pressing. It’s time to double-down.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s something new about this economic model, we have yet to see it. Spotify, Netflix, the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal, and many other businesses have successfully implemented the subscription model. Using it to fund the type of content that Medium aims to highlight may not be feasible, however, as consumers tend to gravitate towards free content and news that is read and shared in the open.</p>\n<p>If Medium&#8217;s only option for exiting the <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2007/03/01/attention_economy_overview/\" target=\"_blank\">attention economy</a> is to further lock down users&#8217; content inside its proprietary silo, the remedy is worse than the disease. Instead of seeing ads on articles available to everyone, subscribers now pay to read content that is selected by and owned by Medium, a company that still needs to find a way to keep the lights on once all the VC money is gone.</p>\n<p>Medium tried the ad-driven publishing model without success and then declared that it was a broken system. Was the model broken because it didn&#8217;t bring Medium enough money to keep paddling on? Or is it fundamentally broken because it &#8220;incentivizes the wrong behaviors,&#8221; as Williams put it? His newfound idealism behind the push to leave the domain of &#8220;ad buyers and social media echo chambers&#8221; appears to be a mask for the lack of a concrete monetization strategy.</p>\n<p>Williams&#8217; closing appeal says everything: &#8220;Join us early, and help us figure it out.&#8221; Medium is still experimenting on publishers to find a way to stay afloat.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 21:24:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: How to Find the Age of a Plugin Hosted in the WordPress Plugin Directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67923\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/how-to-find-the-age-of-a-plugin-hosted-in-the-wordpress-plugin-directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1554:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\">WordPress plugin directory</a> provides information such as version requirements, compatibility, last updated, and active installs for plugins.

Participants are currently working on documenting best practices, including recommendations for PHP versions offered, and providing tools for the community.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 19:15:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"Matt: On the James Altucher Show\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47188\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"https://ma.tt/2017/03/on-the-james-altucher-show/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:450:\"<p>I <a href=\"http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2017/03/matt-mullenweg/\">joined in for the James Altucher podcast in an episode that covered a lot of ground</a>.

Sucuri, founded by Daniel Cid and co-founded by Tony Perez in 2010, is a website security platform that helps clean and protect websites. Details of the deal were not disclosed.</p>\n<p>Like <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-wordpress-site-management-service-managewp\">ManageWP</a>, Sucuri will operate as a separate entity under the GoDaddy umbrella. Sucuri employees will transfer to GoDaddy while remaining under the leadership of Perez and Cid.</p>\n<p>Out of all the companies that Sucuri could have chosen to be acquired by, why GoDaddy?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Over the years we&#8217;ve seen them live up to their words to be a customer and product centric company,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;As a product company it give us an opportunity to scale our product from a few hundred thousand domains, to millions. It&#8217;s something that we only ever dreamed of.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The acquisition comes a few weeks after <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/blog/sg-site-scanner-powered-sucuri/\">SiteGround announced</a> its partnership with Sucuri and renamed its site scanner SG Site Scanner. It&#8217;s too soon to determine how this acquisition will affect Sucuri&#8217;s partnerships with hosting companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t speak for our partners, but I truly hope they will trust in us, Sucuri, and in me personally,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;If we can work to deploy our technology for GoDaddy, at their scale, then I have nothing but confidence we can do this for every other partner out there.</p>\n<p>&#8220;GoDaddy made this investment because they believe in what we have built as a team at Sucuri, the product solves problems, that doesn&#8217;t go away and I hope all our customers and partners will give us time to prove this in our actions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Both companies acknowledged that nothing changes for existing Sucuri customers and that they can expect to see numerous improvements in the near future. Perez and Cid see the acquisition as version 2.0 of the company.</p>\n<p>Aaron Campbell, WordPress Security Team Lead who is sponsored by GoDaddy to work on WordPress full-time, says the move should help make more sites secure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;GoDaddy is committed to offering great services to its clients,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;You know as well as I do that Sucuri is exactly that; we&#8217;ve seen them be quite an asset to the WordPress community over the years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going to remain a standalone product, but I&#8217;m excited to see them become part of the GoDaddy team to make some great stuff together. Keeping as many WordPress users secure as possible is obviously my goal and I really think this will help accomplish that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Reactions to the news on Twitter have mostly been positive with many congratulating Sucuri and its founders.</p>\n<p>On the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/?ref=group_cover\">Advanced WordPress Facebook group</a>, reactions to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1440220396040170/\">the news</a> are a mix between congratulatory and fears of Sucuri&#8217;s service declining. These are among the same grievances and fears expressed by ManageWP customers when <a href=\"https://managewp.com/managewp-joins-godaddy\">GoDaddy acquired it</a>.</p>\n<h2>ManageWP Customers Report No Noticeable Decline in Service</h2>\n<p>Since being acquired, ManageWP has maintained and improved service levels while continuing to add features. Its most recent feature gives customers the opportunity to create backups, restore, and clone <a href=\"https://managewp.com/multisite-websites-in-managewp\">multisite websites</a>.</p>\n<p>Bob Dunn, of <a href=\"https://bobwp.com/\">BobWP</a>, says the service has been stellar before and after the transition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, their services were great before and still are,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;I don’t manage a ton of sites, but for my needs, it has been rock solid since I first became a customer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Scott Buscemi, co-founder of <a href=\"https://lumenfoundry.com/\">Lumen Foundry</a>, has had a similar experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In all honesty, I haven&#8217;t noticed much of anything since they were acquired &#8211; and that&#8217;s a &#8216;win&#8217; in my opinion,&#8221; Buscemi said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen them push out a pleasant list of bug fixes and features that don&#8217;t affect me, so it&#8217;s great to still see active development on the primary system. GoDaddy has been working hard to get on the good side of developers and agency owners like me, so I can&#8217;t imagine they would go through the effort of the acquisition only to spoil the experience and turn things negative.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even those skeptical with the acquisition have reported no noticeable decline in the quality of service.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffr0\">@jeffr0</a> Me, I haven’t really noticed any change in the quality of the service (and I was skeptical)</p>\n<p>&mdash; \"so called\" Jim Cook (@jm_cook) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jm_cook/status/844657355035938816\">March 22, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>GoDaddy has not announced how it plans to integrate Sucuri into its products and services.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 00:53:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress at WordCamp London 2017 Contributor Day\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=264902\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://buddypress.org/2017/03/buddypress-at-wordcamp-london-2017-contributor-day/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1688:\"<p>Contributor Day is a big part of WordCamp London.

The React-based theme is the first in the directory to use the REST API endpoints included in WordPress 4.7. Foxhound sports a tasteful blog design with single-page app functionality that loads posts instantly. Check out the <a href=\"https://themes.redradar.net/foxhound/\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> to see how fast the content loads.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/foxhound.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The theme was designed and developed by <a href=\"https://themes.redradar.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly Dwan and Mel Choyce</a>, who have collaborated on several free themes hosted on WordPress.org. They recommend installing the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-api-menus/\" target=\"_blank\">WP-API Menus</a> plugin, as the REST API does not yet support menus. After installing Foxhound, there are only two things required to make it look like the demo: Set the front page to display the latest posts and set up a menu. There are no additional customization settings.</p>\n<p>Kelly Dwan notes on <a href=\"https://github.com/ryelle/Foxhound\" target=\"_blank\">Foxhound&#8217;s GitHub repository</a> that the theme should be considered &#8220;experimental&#8221; and users can expect a few restrictions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The theme does not display anything if javascript is disabled. (Should not affect SEO or accessibility)</li>\n<li>The API cannot be blocked by a security plugin. Some plugins recommend blocking the users endpoint, but that is required to show the author archive. If you need to block the user endpoint, the rest of the theme should work but might be unstable if anyone tries to visit an author archive.</li>\n<li>Permalinks for pages and archives are changed by this theme. They will be reset if/when you deactivate the theme. You might want to set up redirects using something like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/safe-redirect-manager/\" target=\"_blank\">Safe Redirect Manager</a>.</li>\n<li>This theme does not support hierarchical category archives &#8211; only parent category archive pages can be displayed. This <a href=\"https://github.com/ryelle/Foxhound/issues/30\" target=\"_blank\">may be fixed in a later version</a> of the theme.\n<li>Plugins may not work as expected, especially if they add content to the front end of the site. Most Jetpack features do still work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because Foxhound is so different from traditional WordPress themes, it could not go through the usual theme review process. Themes that require the WP REST API are currently reviewed outside of WordPress.org when a theme author pings the Theme Review team. They apply a &#8220;Special Case&#8221; tag that allows the theme to bypass Theme Check.

Coming from a modest family background, the realization of achievement dawned over me. I never favored being a 9 to 5 corporate professional and a having a ‘boss’ was simply not my cup of coffee. I was never interested in the classes held in the college because I was being more productive at the ‘reality’ front of the life. I envisioned getting involved in tasks that were strongest at the core.</p>\n<h3>Where It All Started</h3>\n<p>Computer technology was in its nascent state in India the time I started my tryst with web pages. I began with designing my own college’s alumni website while pursuing MCA at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. Eventually, I was assigned the task of the event websites too. I was happy because all this brought about a sense of power to me. Though not initially refine, my work still appealed to many and it also made me realize the power technology had.</p>\n<h3>The Seed of Seriousness</h3>\n<p>The very first seed of the idea of taking this up as a serious profession was sown by a friend who told me about how creating web pages and blogging could be a source of monetization. Google pages was my first shot as a techie, wherein I started with contributing content through blogs to several clients.</p>\n<h3>Saw and Attempted</h3>\n<p>I can still recollect the time I received my first pay cheque. Initially, I had tested all Content management systems and had started with Joomla and Drupal. With absolutely no knowledge about coding, I went forward to scale the web designing mountain. WordPress came and was well recognized as a blogging platform; suitable to what I worked on. I bumped into WordPress in 2009 and like many other users, utilized it for my blogging endeavors. Little did I know that someday it would be the answer to my ‘coding gap’. I remember working on a 6-month project for my MCA final where I took up WordPress as the core subject and in there I talked about custom plugins and themes. The teacher was happy to receive the unique project and awarded me good grades for my sense of initiation with new approach.</p>\n<h3>That Leap of Faith</h3>\n<p>Now, I knew how I had to take this WordPress awesomeness forward. With a little exposure to learning new technology, I was baffled for a while but had the will to scale this one too. 6 months, and I thoroughly decoded the WordPress codex for me. This was a giant step forward where my future lay in my own hands.</p>\n<p>Personally, I feel that WordPress does not constrict you to a certain limit or a line of functionalities. If you have a core foundation, you can toy with it and make awesome end results. WordPress was now my pillar of strength. WordPress successfully justified my choice of not joining the job placement drive at the college.</p>\n<h3>The Break-Out</h3>\n<p>Now was the time to materialize my skills and have a material turnaround for the work I was capable of doing. After a 4-month hunt for some serious web designing projects with not a single task at hand, disappointment gripped me. The lack of proper work infrastructure due to poor Internet connectivity and local electricity supply were some of the other reasons I had to plan withdrawing my resources from Varanasi. I could have fallen or would have made a leap; it was about to be my choice for the rest of my life.</p>\n<h3>Hello to New Beginnings</h3>\n<p>It was frustrating because Varanasi had been my abode for 7 good years and leaving the place was a huge decision to make. I mustered up my wits to start afresh by withdrawing my base from Varanasi and shifted to Lucknow, India in order to try out seeking new opportunities yet again.</p>\n<p>The work stars favored me and with the help of elance-oDesk (now, Upwork) and other freelancing platforms, I received many life-changing projects of my life. Things moved forward and with many clients in a row, another year went by. I collaborated with more people who were willing to join me on the platform – people who wanted to leave a mark; never to look back. What remained constant throughout these years was my capability to work hard each day.</p>\n<h3>A Better Picture/ Wbcom Designs</h3>\n<p>I upfront admire WordPress because it has been a driving force for my existence. Time has moved slowly and with 6+ years of experience and self-discovery, I now run a fully-fledged WordPress based company <a href=\"https://wbcomdesigns.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wbcom Designs</a> that has many developers and freelancers onboard with me.</p>\n<p>While additionally serving <a href=\"https://www.buddyboss.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyBoss</a> as a Product and Support Manager, now I plan to infuse new changes in the pattern we operate at base as well as the firm through strategic planning. It’s time to give back to the WordPress community through the development of free plugins, theme customization and spreading the WordPress fandom at local level.</p>\n<p>I recently took the <a href=\"https://2016.nashik.wordcamp.org/wbcomdesigns-is-our-bronze-sponsor/\">opportunity to sponsor</a> <a href=\"https://2016.nashik.wordcamp.org/\">‘Nashik WordCamp’ 2016</a>, <a href=\"https://2017.pune.wordcamp.org/sponsors/\">WordCamp Pune 2017</a>, <a href=\"https://2017.udaipur.wordcamp.org/sponsors/\">WordCamp Udaipur 2017</a>, and <a href=\"https://2017.kochi.wordcamp.org/sponsors/\">WordCamp Kochi 2017</a>. I am glad I was able to take a step forward in my plans to pay back to the WordPress community. To set the ball rolling at local level, I have recently come up with a local <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Lucknow-WordPress-Meetup/\">MeetUp</a> group at Lucknow, India so that locally organized, face to face events can be organized that will accelerate the understanding of the WordPress CMS among the masses. I also plan to bring about WordPress awareness at the school and college level in my zone so that more and more young people know why this CMS is so amazing.</p>\n<p>To this day, my first love is my work desk. Whenever in an emotional or professional fix, I seek recluse through this amazing platform. Unlike others, working destresses me. There is a long way to go with this ideal because I want people to know how powerfully stable the WordPress is.</p>\n<p>Like they say,</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I want to see the developer community going for heights that have never been achieved before and I want to be a part of this huge step-up.</p>\n<p>I am all open up for this WordPress community for contribution and assistance. For WordPress enthusiasts, I want to tell them that sky is not the limit. WordPress has accepted me as its own and it’s time for me and others to give back in the best possible manner.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: A Blissful Driving Force\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=A%20Blissful%20Driving%20Force&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fblissful-driving-force%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: A Blissful Driving Force\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fblissful-driving-force%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fblissful-driving-force%2F&title=A+Blissful+Driving+Force\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: A Blissful Driving Force\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/blissful-driving-force/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/032217-150x150.jpg&description=A Blissful Driving Force\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: A Blissful Driving Force\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/blissful-driving-force/\" title=\"A Blissful Driving Force\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/blissful-driving-force/\">A Blissful Driving Force</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 12:00:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Varun Dubey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Help Jesse Petersen and His Family by Donating to His Medical Leave Fund\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67746\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/help-jesse-petersen-and-his-family-by-donating-to-his-medical-leave-fund\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2774:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.petersenmediagroup.com/\">Jesse Petersen</a>, a longtime member of the WordPress community and founder of <a href=\"https://www.genesisthe.me/\">Genesis The.me</a>, needs <a href=\"https://www.newlungsfor.me/medical-leave-fund-for-jesses-double-lung-transplant/\">our help</a>. Petersen is battling <a href=\"http://www.cffatboy.com/what-is-cystic-fibrosis/\">Cystic Fibrosis</a> and earlier this year after visiting a clinic, discovered that his lung function was at 22%.</p>\n<p>Due to decrease lung function, Petersen missed five weeks of work, required home IVs, and visited many doctors. He is currently on a double-lung transplant list with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_allocation_score\">lung allocation score</a> of 38.859.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.unos.org/wp-content/uploads/unos/lung_allocation_score.pdf\">United Network for Organ Sharing</a>, the LAS is a score used to prioritize waiting list candidates based on a combination of wait list urgency and post-transplant survival.</p>\n<p>In order to maintain his health for a transplant, doctors have recommended that he work a maximum of two hours per day with quality rest.</p>\n<p>His family has a small emergency fund available that they thought would allow Petersen to work up until his transplant surgery. However, there&#8217;s no estimated time frame for when a transplant will be available.</p>\n<p>Outside of his product based business, Petersen is a work-from-home freelancer with contract work that needs to be completed. He and his wife have two adopted children. His wife volunteered to get another job to supplement their income but relatives rejected the idea as she is his primary support person.</p>\n<p>Petersen has <a href=\"https://my.genesisthe.me/downloads/genesistheme-developer-starter/\">two products</a> for sale on GenesisThe.me with two more ready for launch by the end of March.</p>\n<p>His family is <a href=\"https://www.newlungsfor.me/medical-leave-fund-for-jesses-double-lung-transplant/\">asking for $20K </a>to help pay for expenses and allow Petersen to take an extended medical leave to focus on his health. So far, the campaign has raised $5,075 or about a quarter of the amount needed.</p>\n<p>You can donate as much as you&#8217;re able to or choose from one of five predetermined amounts ranging from $25 to $1K. You can also choose to donate monthly in six month increments.</p>\n<p>Petersen is no stranger to the WordPress community&#8217;s generosity. In 2016, it helped him raise nearly $20K to help pay for costs associated with <a href=\"https://surpriseadoption.com/\">adopting his second son</a>. If you are able, please consider donating to Petersen&#8217;s medical leave fund.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 10:35:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Adding Images to WordPress Sidebars Is About to Get a Lot Easier\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67667\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/adding-images-to-wordpress-sidebars-is-about-to-get-a-lot-easier\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4041:\"<p>Adding images to sidebars in WordPress is a cumbersome task that requires users to upload an image to the Media Library, find the URL, copy it, and paste it into a Text widget along with additional HTML. Nearly two years ago, Mel Choyce <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32417\">opened a ticket</a> on WordPress Trac proposing that a media widget be added to core. This widget would allow users to easily add images to sidebars.</p>\n<p>Throughout the discussion, the idea of creating a catch-all media widget was brought up that would allow users to add images, audio, or video to a sidebar. After developers spoke to Matt Mullenweg about the direction of the project, the team decided to create three separate widgets to handle each media type. Choyce outlined the benefits this approach provides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can focus on creating more tailored experiences for each widget.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ll be able to launch new widgets without having to worry about constantly updating one central widget, or potentially breaking anything.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;ll be easier for people to discover new media types since they won&#8217;t be buried within one widget.</li>\n<li>This will more closely mimic the approach we&#8217;re taking to content blocks in the future, which should provide an easier transition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Out of the three core widgets in development, the Image one is nearly complete ready for user testing. To test, first download and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-core-media-widgets/\">Core Media Widgets</a> plugin. Once activated, navigate to Appearance &gt; Widgets in the WordPress backend and in the available widgets section, locate the Image widget.</p>\n<img />Core Image Widget UI\n<p>Clicking the Select Image button displays the media library modal where you can either select or upload an image. Once an image is selected, click the Add to Widget button in the bottom-right corner. This is what the widget looks like after an image is added.</p>\n<img />Core Image Widget With an Image\n<p>Here is what the widget looks like on a page using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/\">Twenty Seventeen</a> default theme.</p>\n<img />Core Image Widget in Action\n<p>The core image widget is incredibly easy to set up and is a significant improvement over the Text widget approach. The user interface is much simpler compared to the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/extra-sidebar-widgets/image-widget/\">image widget</a> supplied by Jetpack. Jetpack&#8217;s image widget UI doesn&#8217;t take advantage of the media library modal and instead, requires the user to know the image&#8217;s URL.</p>\n<img />Jetpack Image Widget UI\n<p>Many of the fields are the same as what&#8217;s provided by the media library modal. Not surprisingly, WordPress.com <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/widgets/image-widget/\">uses the same interface</a> and requires the user to know the image URL.</p>\n<h2>Core Image Widget May Be Ready in Time for WordPress 4.7.4</h2>\n<p>The team is specifically seeking feedback from those who use image widgets provided by plugins on WordPress.org. Once the image widget is merged into core, the video and audio widgets will be added to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-core-media-widgets/\">Core Media Widgets</a> plugin. Users can leave the plugin enabled until all three widgets are added to core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once a widget has been thoroughly tested by users, we can then copy it into core for a release while then also disabling the widget in the plugin,&#8221; Ruter said.</p>\n<p>If you encounter a bug or discover an incompatibility with a plugin or theme, please <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-core-media-widgets/issues\">create an issue</a> on the project&#8217;s GitHub page. According to Ruter, the team is working hard to get the widget to a point where it can be merged into core. Depending on how testing goes, it could be merged into core as early as WordPress 4.7.4.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 01:18:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: WordPress Theme Review Team Making Progress on Clearing Out 1,000+ Review Backlog\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67582\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-making-progress-on-clearing-out-1000-review-backlog\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6259:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/planning.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/5ZMT04MIW6\">Oli Dale</a>\n<p>The WordPress Theme Review team (TRT) has turned a corner and is approaching a major milestone of getting the <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/report/2\" target=\"_blank\">review queue</a> under 100 themes.

The TRT is working hard to make 2017 the year they get back on track.</p>\n<p>Uzelac identified a few of the measures that have helped in taming the queue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One theme submission per author</li>\n<li>More reviewers</li>\n<li>A new guideline where reviewers close the ticket if the review surfaces more than <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2016/08/23/meeting-summary-2016-23-08/\" target=\"_blank\">5 distinct issues</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;Around Christmas was when many on the team started seeing a tiny sliver of light at the end of a long tunnel,&#8221; Key Reviewer Justin Tadlock said. &#8220;In the past few days, seeing the queue get below 200 themes has been a high point.  Folks on the team are excited because our ideas are paying off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock can&#8217;t say when exactly the team turned a corner but describes it as more of an iterative process that started with small ideas they could implement themselves. This has significantly reduced the wait time from 7 or 8 months a year ago to two months today. Themes also go through an admin queue that adds a bit to the review time but Tadlock said they hope to tackle that in the next Review Shindig, which happens on the first weekend of every month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That number is shrinking,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;By the end of April, we could be looking at 3-4 weeks. I&#8217;m a bit optimistic, so don&#8217;t hold me to that. It could be May or June in reality.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock said once the team gets to the 50-100 range they will be at the place where they&#8217;re really only handling new themes that are coming in, instead of working the backlog. Once they reach that milestone, they will be able to more accurately track how long it takes for a theme to make it through the review process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where we&#8217;ll need to really start refining the process so that it works even better in the future,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;A well-coded theme could potentially make it through the process in 2 months right now. Another theme might be 4-5 months. There are a lot of factors to consider. It&#8217;s my hope that we eliminate many of those factors that are holding up the process.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The new rule that limited authors to submitting one theme at a time has had a significant impact on cutting down the queue. The rule was meant to be temporary and will be up for reevaluation when the queue is under 100 themes. Tadlock said the team will likely pull the rule, but it has been instrumental in rooting out copies that contained only minor changes to the original.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For most authors, this [rule] is not a huge problem,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;It definitely hurts a few of the more prolific authors in the short term. However, it helps stop the flow of theme companies who are just copying/pasting the same theme with minor changes. We&#8217;ve had theme companies with as many as 17 themes in the queue that were just copies.  This new rule has helped us find those and put a stop to the practice.&#8221; The team was able to track down an entire ring of theme authors with multiple accounts with dozens and dozens of themes.</p>\n<p>Tadlock said most of the issues the team deals with in reviews are related to security. The content portability issues that were highlighted in the recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zerif-lite-returns-to-wordpress-org-after-5-month-suspension-and-63-decline-in-revenue\" target=\"_blank\">Zerif Lite suspension</a> are more uncommon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The &#8216;draconian stuff&#8217; people talk about probably represents 1% of the issue,&#8221; Tadlock said, referencing Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zerif-lite-returns-to-wordpress-org-after-5-month-suspension-and-63-decline-in-revenue#comment-210935\" target=\"_blank\">comments</a> on the current requirements. &#8220;99% of the issues are the things people don&#8217;t talk about.&#8221; Tadlock has been speaking with theme authors about how they can &#8220;create&#8221; content within the guidelines, as there are ways to do it that are both future-proof and portable.</p>\n<p>The team is currently spending a lot of time reviewing code that shouldn&#8217;t need to be manually reviewed. The next item on the TRT roadmap is incorporating better automation into the review process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The big thing we&#8217;re working on now is the new Theme Check plugin,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to solve lots of problems.  It&#8217;s based off the code sniffer (PHPCS, I believe). It&#8217;ll help theme authors start submitting better coded and more secure themes right off the bat. Humans easily miss those things looking through it with their eyes. This will definitely make theme authors better coders and users will have even more secure themes. Then, we can focus on those 1% issues.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 21:53:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WPTavern: Yoast SEO 4.5 Urges Users to Upgrade to PHP 7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67676\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wptavern.com/yoast-seo-4-5-urges-users-to-upgrade-to-php-7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4770:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/yoast-logo.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-4-5/\" target=\"_blank\">Yoast SEO 4.5</a> was released today with a handful of improvements and, most notably, a big push for users to upgrade to PHP 7.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In Yoast SEO 4.5, we are urging site owners whose sites run on servers with an outdated version of PHP to update to a more recent version,&#8221; Joost de Valk said. &#8220;To move the web forward, we need to take a stand against old, slow, and unsafe software.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; minimum PHP requirement is still at <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/\" target=\"_blank\">5.2.4</a>, six years after PHP 5.2 <a href=\"http://php.net/eol.php\" target=\"_blank\">reached end of life in 2011</a>. This version is now <a href=\"https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=74&product_id=128&version_id=106044&page=1&hasexp=0&opdos=0&opec=0&opov=0&opcsrf=0&opgpriv=0&opsqli=0&opxss=0&opdirt=0&opmemc=0&ophttprs=0&opbyp=0&opfileinc=0&opginf=0&cvssscoremin=0&cvssscoremax=0&year=0&month=0&cweid=0&order=4&trc=39\" target=\"_blank\">vulnerable to many security issues</a>. Current usage stats show 5.4% of WordPress sites are running on PHP 5.2. As this likely represents millions of users, WordPress&#8217; core leadership is reluctant to bump the minimum requirements. Only 8% of sites are on PHP 7+, as hosting companies are slowly adding support.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wordpress-php-versions-march-2017-1.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>“Because web hosts are not upgrading PHP, we have decided to start pushing this from within plugins,&#8221; de Valk said. He contends that the WordPress ecosystem is losing good developers because the project is moving too slowly. He also makes the case for security and speed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress is sometimes said to be slow, but it actually doesn’t have to be slow at all,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;If it’s running on old versions of PHP, however, it is, most certainly, slow. PHP 5.2 is more than 100% slower than PHP 5.6, and a whopping <a href=\"https://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/493-php-performance-evolution.html\" target=\"_blank\">400% slower than PHP 7</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>De Valk decided to throw the weight of Yoast SEO, which he estimates to be 6.5 million active installs, behind the movement to push hosts to upgrade their customers to PHP 7. The latest release of the plugin displays a notice to WordPress administrators running sites on PHP 5.2, urging them to upgrade to PHP 7. The notice is &#8220;big, ugly, and non-dismissible,&#8221; de Valk said. It is generated by an error that auto-resolves when the user fixes their outdated PHP version.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The notice will also encourage people to contact their host if they don’t know how to upgrade their PHP,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;Yes, this could be painful for some hosts. This notice is deliberately intended to make them work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>De Valk said the plugin will start displaying the notices for PHP 5.2 and will add 5.6 as soon as it is no longer supported. Through experience with his customers, de Valk has found that outdated, slower versions of PHP are damaging Yoast SEO and WordPress&#8217; reputations, as neither are optimized for PHP 5.2. Although older versions are not holding the plugin back from new features, it makes it difficult for the team to clean up the code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t many features I cannot build right now, but code quality is suffering because we can&#8217;t use namespaces, short array notation, etc,&#8221; de Valk said.</p>\n<p>The Yoast SEO team has created <a href=\"https://github.com/Yoast/whip\" target=\"_blank\">WHIP</a>, a WordPress package to nudge users to upgrade their software versions and made it open source for plugin and theme developers to implement in their own extensions. The project includes a filter for linking to the WordPress.org hosting page, which includes a selection of hosts that offer PHP 7.</p>\n<p>Most of the large hosting companies already have documentation for upgrading PHP versions. Ultimately, it&#8217;s the end users who will have the power to get more hosting companies on board. De Valk said he doesn&#8217;t know how big the impact will be but encourages users to vote with their pocketbooks by leaving hosts that are unwilling to assist in upgrading PHP.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It might be entirely possible that your host is not willing to work with you,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;If so, think about moving web hosts. A web host provides the engine your site runs on and that better be a damn good engine.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 19:56:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:119:\"WPTavern: PressShack Forks Edit Flow to Create PublishPress, Aims to Improve Multi-User Editorial Workflow in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67574\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:129:\"https://wptavern.com/pressshack-forks-edit-flow-to-create-publishpress-aims-to-improve-multi-user-editorial-workflow-in-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6808:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/publish-press.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Last week Steve Burge and the team at <a href=\"https://pressshack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PressShack</a> released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/publishpress/\" target=\"_blank\">PublishPress</a>, a fork of Automattic&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/\" target=\"_blank\">Edit Flow</a> plugin. PressShack is operated by the same team behind <a href=\"http://ostraining.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OSTraining</a> with a focus on creating publishing plugins for larger organizations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/\" target=\"_blank\">Edit Flow</a> has more than 10,000 active installs but is updated sporadically and is not very well supported. The PressShack creators saw an opportunity to fork the plugin and sell commercial support and add-ons. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/publishpress/\" target=\"_blank\">PublishPress</a> is now available on WordPress.org with a seamless <a href=\"https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/migrate/\" target=\"_blank\">migration for Edit Flow users</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/edit-flow-publishpress-migration.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The first release offers the same features as Edit Flow along with a complete face lift, making interaction with the plugin&#8217;s settings more user-friendly. The new tabbed interface puts all the settings on one screen. PressShack has also tweaked the language of the plugin, changing Story Budget” to “Overview”, and simplifying other terms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/publishpress-ui.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>PublishPress introduces a few changes to the calendar, allowing users to click anywhere on a date to add content. It exposes the iCal or Google Calendar feed and uses icons to show post statuses, saving space for other information.</p>\n<p>Burge said that PublishPress will be making a fresh start and will not be following and incorporating updates from Edit Flow. The team plans to add a host of new features that improve the publishing workflow to handle multiple users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multisite and multiple site support</strong>: Content creators log into one site but can publish to multiple sites</li>\n<li><strong>Pre-publishing checklists</strong>: For example, featured image, word count, Yoast SEO green light</li>\n<li><strong>More use cases beyond media sites</strong>: In addition to magazine-style user groups for reporting, PublishPress plans to add more use cases, such as WooCommerce products, EDD downloads, bbPress topics, and The Events Calendar listings</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple authors</strong>: Assign multiple author bylines to a story</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of these feature are slated for release in mid-2017 and will be <a href=\"https://pressshack.com/publishpress/\" target=\"_blank\">offered as commercial add-ons</a>. The team is currently still focused on writing unit tests for the core plugin and adding improvements to it on WordPress.org.</p>\n<h3>PressShack Takes Inspiration from Drupal for Expanding Content Workflows</h3>\n<p>PressShack&#8217;s creators also work closely with other open source publishing platforms. Burge said the team took some inspiration from the Drupal ecosystem, which offers more advanced features for modifying editorial workflows.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In Drupal, the workflow features are being demanded and developed by large organizations that use the platform,&#8221; Burge said. &#8220;As a result, Drupal does have a very big head start in this area. &#8220;In Drupal 7, the main workflow module was called <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/workbench\" target=\"_blank\">Workbench</a>. It was built to meet the needs of large customers such as universities, media outlets, and government agencies who have many different content managers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Prior to having editorial workflow tools available, Burge said that Drupal agencies kept losing projects to rivals such as Adobe and OpenText, because they had publishing workflows built for multiple users. Building better publishing tools became a necessity for Drupal agencies that wanted to win projects from large organizations.</p>\n<p>Drupal 8 moves many of these editorial workflow improvements into core. Drupal 8.3, which is slated for April 2017, will <a href=\"http://buytaert.net/moving-the-drupal-8-workflow-initiative-along\" target=\"_blank\">introduce the ability to create multiple types of content workflows</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What’s really interesting about the Drupal 8 implementation is that they are thinking beyond just content publishing,&#8221; Burge said. &#8220;It will soon be possible to put whole sections of your site into a workflow. The demand for these features is still coming from enterprise customers: much of the work is being done by a team of Drupal developers inside Pfizer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Burge cited a few examples of typical users requiring more elaborate publishing workflows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A university with 50+ academic departments and several hundred content creators</li>\n<li>A pharmaceutical company with hundreds of products and a micro-site for each one</li>\n<li>A newspaper that employs writers and at least one layer of editors</li>\n<li>A publicly-listed company that needs approval from several staff members to ensure that the content it publishes is 110% accurate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress core is tailored to a single-author blog workflow, and there are relatively few plugins that modify the default editorial workflow for large teams. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/coschedule-a-viable-alternative-to-the-edit-flow-wordpress-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">CoSchedule is one alternative to Edit Flow</a> and PublishPress that has 10,000 active installs. It takes a SaaS approach and has more of a content marketing slant. Burge said he thinks the WordPress ecosystem&#8217;s scarcity of options for extending publishing workflows may be due to current limitations in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s possible there are some technical hurdles: for example, WordPress core has fairly limited user permissions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s also possible that now is the right time for WordPress to start adding these features.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress agencies are building more enterprise sites and these demands are popping-up,&#8221; Burge said. &#8220;Matt just announced the <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/03/wordpress-collaborative-editing/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Docs integration</a> as a quick way to bring some collaborative features into WordPress. I think we’ll see more and more tools available for teams, rather than single authors.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 21:21:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"Donncha: How to Auto Schedule WordPress Posts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://odd.blog/?p=89500175\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://odd.blog/2017/03/18/how-to-auto-schedule-wordpress-posts/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3613:\"<p>If you post to a WordPress blog on a regular basis like I do on <a href=\"https://inphotos.org/\">In Photos dot Org</a> you&#8217;ll no doubt recognise the fatigue that comes from adjusting the publish date every single time on a new post so it appears a day later. If you have multiple posts like on a daily photoblog you have to remember what day the last post was made and adjust the date accordingly. </p>\n<p>A few years ago I wrote a small plugin that I never released to help schedule posts. In the media uploader you could select multiple photos and click a few buttons to be brought to a new page where you could enter title, content and tags for each image. Based on this experience, I suggested it as an idea to one of the teams at Automattic who built <a href=\"https://postbot.co/\">Post Bot</a>. I used that for a long time and it has its strengths. If you&#8217;re posting content that has the same or similar tags you can copy and paste the tags from one post to another. I posted lots of black and white street images from my home town this way and it was super useful! </p>\n<p>I got tired of manually typing out tags, and unfortunately the site broke a few times, with posts not scheduling or one time they scheduled all in one go. Luckily the problems were quickly fixed. However, I started using the WordPress post editor again and scheduling a bunch of photos that way.</p>\n<p>Manually editing the publish date quickly became a chore. Lazarus, the form saver Chrome extension, would sometimes popup if I didn&#8217;t click exactly on the date, or as I said before I had to remember when the last post was made. They say there&#8217;s a plugin for everything, and there is for this too. Check out <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/publish-to-schedule/\">Publish to Schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>You tell &#8220;Publish to Schedule&#8221; which days and how many posts should be published and when you go into the post editor the next available date is picked for you! The date doesn&#8217;t change until you hit Publish but I already used it to schedule a number of posts and it works really well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://odd.blog/files/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-14-at-17.21.11.png\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I forgot to mention <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/daily-image/\">Daily Image</a> a new plugin by Sam Hotchkiss that does the same sort of job as Postbot but it runs on your own server. The first time you load the plugin it will show you every single unattached image in your media library which can be quite a number of images but it allows you to enter tags and quickly schedule images for posting in a simple manner.</p>\n<p>Since my focus here is on image posts I should really mention the <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/lightroom/\">WordPress Export Plugin for Lightroom</a>. When installed you can create a new export target that will resize and sharpen your image and upload it to your blog, even if it&#8217;s not a WordPress.com site.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2010/09/07/odd-games-of-bad-company-2/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Odd games of bad company 2!\">Odd games of bad company 2!</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2010/12/28/im-on-top-of-the-world/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: I&#8217;m on top of the world\">I&#8217;m on top of the world</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2010/09/03/rage-quit-in-cod-4/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Rage quit in COD 4!\">Rage quit in COD 4!</a></li></ul></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://odd.blog/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Source</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 16:50:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Donncha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: GitHub Adds Plain English Explanations to License Pages for Open Source Projects\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67550\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/github-adds-plain-english-explanations-to-license-pages-for-open-source-projects\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2475:\"<p>GitHub took another step towards beefing up its support for open source projects this week with <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/2335-open-source-license-descriptions-and-metadata\" target=\"_blank\">a new feature that makes it easier to understand a project&#8217;s license</a>. If the project is using a popular open source license, GitHub will automatically add a short, plain-English description of the license and its permissions, conditions, and limitations. This allows GitHub users to see the implications of a project&#8217;s license at a glance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/github-license-display.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>GitHub pulls this data from <a href=\"http://ChooseALicense.com\" target=\"_blank\">ChooseALicense.com</a>, the site it created in 2013 to help developers understand and select an open source license. The license descriptions and metadata are also open source and developers can incorporate them into their own projects using GitHub&#8217;s <a href=\"https://developer.github.com/v3/licenses/#get-an-individual-license\" target=\"_blank\">License API</a>.</p>\n<p>This new feature follows GitHub&#8217;s release of <a href=\"https://opensource.guide/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Source Guides</a> in February. The guides are a collection of 10 resources to help people get involved in open source, start their own open source projects, and manage large communities. The documents include helpful stories and tips from maintainers of successful open source projects.</p>\n<p>It was around this time last year that GitHub was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/open-source-project-maintainers-confront-github-with-open-letter-on-issue-management\" target=\"_blank\">confronted by open source project maintainers with an open letter</a> of complaints regarding issue management. Nearly 2,000 maintainers signed the letter, requesting that GitHub prioritize features that open source project maintainers need. The company dragged its feet before eventually responding, while competing code hosting service GitLab capitalized on the situation with a new initiative focused on “<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/8938\" target=\"_blank\">making GitLab the best place for big open source projects</a>.” Over the past year, GitHub has consistently released new features and improved existing ones in affirmation of its continued support for open source projects.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 03:03:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"WPTavern: In Case You Missed It – Issue 19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=67590&preview=true&preview_id=67590\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://wptavern.com/in-case-you-missed-it-issue-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5660:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICYMIFeaturedImage.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-50955\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/112901923@N07/16153818039\">Night Moves</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>There’s a lot of great WordPress content published in the community but not all of it is featured on the Tavern. This post is an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didn’t make it into a full post.</p>\n<h2>Apple Pay for WooCommerce</h2>\n<p>WooCommerce <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2017/03/apple-pay-woocommerce/\">announced</a> that Apple Pay is now available for stores accepting payments using Stripe. According to Marina Pape, WooCommerce is the first open source platform to integrate with Apple Pay.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’re also proud to be the first open source platform to integrate with Apple Pay. Open source is the default for us, but it’s exciting to continue that level of openness with such an important payment solution.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Human Made Makes Two Big Hires</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://hmn.md/\">Human Made</a>, a web development agency based in the UK recently announced two big hires. The first is <a href=\"https://hmn.md/2017/03/16/mike-little-joins-human-made/\">Mike Little</a>, co-creator of the WordPress open source project, as a WordPress Specialist. The second is <a href=\"https://hmn.md/2017/03/17/jenny-beaumont-joins-human-made/\">Jenny Beaumont</a>, who will take on the role of Senior Project Manager.</p>\n<h2>Editor User Experience Survey</h2>\n<p>The WordPress core development team has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/03/15/editor-experience-survey/\">published a survey</a> seeking feedback and data on how people use the editor. The editor is likely the most commonly used feature in WordPress. This is an opportunity for those who use it to provide feedback.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/03/15/editor-experience-survey/\">Editor Experience Survey</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Behind the Scenes of how Search works on the New WordPress Plugin Directory</h2>\n<p>Greg Brown <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/03/15/improving-relevance-and-elasticsearch-query-patterns/\">published details</a> on Data.blog on how he improved the search relevancy for the new WordPress plugin directory using Elasticsearch. The post is technical in nature but provides great background information into how it works.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In improving the fidelity of search results, it’s not just a question of how we satisfy a single user’s search query, but how we satisfy thousands of users for each unique search term: which plugins will support that volume of users and their requests for support?

Burns describes the hardships encountered with her first job and how it and other circumstances led her down the path of discovering WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>By this point I’d started playing around with WordPress, and I learned about a local meetup group. I tiptoed in one night and awkwardly introduced myself and was welcomed right in.</p>\n<p>I realized over time that this was a very different sort of group. Everyone was grassroots volunteers, putting in the effort because they wanted to learn, not because they wanted social status. There was no tiresome hierarchy, no obsession with &#8216;prestige&#8217;, no kowtowing to the person with the sexiest car (in fact, we all took the bus.) If you had a question, you could ask it without being laughed out the room. No one was obliged to give anything more than they were able to give.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>HeroPress Wapuu!</h2>\n<p>In what is a traditional part of this series, I end each issue by featuring a Wapuu design. For those who don&#8217;t know, Wapuu is the <a href=\"http://wapuu.jp/2015/12/12/wapuu-origins/\">unofficial mascot</a> of the WordPress project.</p>\n<img />HeroPress Wapuu\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I present HeroPress Wapuu in celebration of HeroPress recently publishing <a href=\"https://heropress.com/heropress-at-100/\">its 100th essay. </a>If you&#8217;re a fan of HeroPress and want to see it flourish, please consider <a href=\"https://heropress.com/sponsorship/\">being a sponsor</a>.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for issue nineteen.

The results of the short 15-question survey will assist the team in redesigning the editing experience in the WordPress admin.</p>\n<p>Participants are asked to identify how they use WordPress and if they use certain features like formatting buttons and distraction-free writing. The survey also asks how easy-to-use they consider the current editor to be and how organized it is. Users are also asked if they have ever installed a plugin that adds features to the editor, presumably to determine if there are features missing that should be considered for core.</p>\n<p>One question asks participants if they use any assistive technologies along with a screen reader. WordPress Accessibility team member Amanda Rush <a href=\"https://www.customerservant.com/wordpress-editor-experience-survey/\" target=\"_blank\">published some tips for screen reader users who want to take the survey</a>. It includes several questions with radio buttons and screenshots that are not so friendly to screen readers. Rush provides a general walk-through with more explanation for those who are using screen readers to participate.</p>\n<p>So far, this survey has been more widely shared than the design team&#8217;s recent customizer survey, which was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/initial-customizer-survey-results-reveal-majority-of-respondents-dont-use-it\" target=\"_blank\">published after receiving just 50 results</a>. WordPress contributors rely heavily on these surveys to make decisions about projects they are working on, as they do not have any telemetry data about what features people are using or not using. This is one example where data could quickly demonstrate how widely the distraction-free writing mode has been adopted and show what editor formatting buttons people are using.</p>\n<p>If you have a few minutes over the weekend and want to contribute to the future of WordPress, take the <a href=\"http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/editor-survey\" target=\"_blank\">Editor Experience Survey</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 21:01:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: How to View Upcoming WordCamps in the WordPress Dashboard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67572\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/how-to-view-upcoming-wordcamps-in-the-wordpress-dashboard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2067:\"<p>Over the course of a year, WordCamps take place nearly every weekend. Although you can view <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">upcoming events</a> on WordCamp Central, a relatively new plugin exist that enables you to see upcoming WordCamps on the WordPress Dashboard.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wc-dashboard-widget/\">WordCamp Dashboard Widget</a> developed by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ajitbohra/\">Ajit Bohra</a>. Once activated, a new widget appears on the dashboard that lists upcoming WordCamps. Data is retrieved by using the public <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/wp-json/posts?type=wordcamp%29\">JSON API</a> available on WordCamp Central, is stored in a transient, and refreshed every day to reflect new data.</p>\n<img />Upcoming WordCamps Widget\n<p>Users can adjust the number of camps shown per page, sort events by location, date, or Twitter information. You can also display this information on any post or page using the [wordcamps] shortcode. The locations are linked to the event&#8217;s official WordCamp page. The @ symbol links to the official Twitter account associated with the event and the # symbol links to the official hashtag.</p>\n<p>During testing I noticed that the Twitter account for some events was either missing or incorrect. For example, WordCamp London links to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wcldn\">@wcldn</a> when it should link to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WordCampLondon\">@WordCampLondon</a>.

Jetpack users can browse, preview, and activate themes by visiting the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/design\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com Theme Showcase</a>. WordPress.com has also added the ability for Jetpack users to upload a theme from its interface as well, a feature that targets those who are heavily using Jetpack Manage instead of the WordPress admin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/jetpack-theme-install.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Many of the free themes are already available from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/automattic/\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic&#8217;s account</a> on the WordPress.org Themes Directory, but the limitations of the preview functionality doesn&#8217;t present themes in their best light. The Theme Review Team added a new rule last year that theme authors can only upload one theme at a time and will have to wait for it to pass through the queue before submitting another. This severely restricts individuals and companies that are prolific theme authors, requiring them to wait months in the queue. Authors can realistically expect to only publish one or two themes per year on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>After Zerif Lite, one of the most popular themes on WordPress.org, was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zerif-lite-returns-to-wordpress-org-after-5-month-suspension-and-63-decline-in-revenue\" target=\"_blank\">suspended for five months</a> for violations of content portability requirements, Matt Mullenweg was one of the most vocal opponents of what he <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zerif-lite-returns-to-wordpress-org-after-5-month-suspension-and-63-decline-in-revenue#comment-210935\" target=\"_blank\">called</a> &#8220;draconian requirements.&#8221; In 2015, Mullenweg went so far to <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1432861605003292\" target=\"_blank\">say</a> that he is &#8220;completely okay with having something in the directory that breaks every guideline, as long as it’s interesting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Theme Review Team has not made significant changes that would give authors more freedom. Instead, much of the Team&#8217;s time seems to be spent looking for ways to reduce the queue. It&#8217;s no wonder that a company like Automattic, with the infrastructure of Jetpack Manage and WordPress.com, would choose to distribute themes via a more efficient route. However, this move has left some WordPress.org theme authors wondering if WordPress.org improvements will be less of a priority in the future.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Can you blame him?

It&#8217;s a calculated measure to control the on-boarding experience of new users, which WP desperately needs for continued growth amidst a field of competitors like Wix and Squarespace.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to Jetpack team member Richard Muscat, WordPress.com has &#8220;no immediate plans to sell themes at this time.&#8221; Jetpack users have access to free themes but will not, in the foreseeable future, be invited to purchase WordPress.com&#8217;s commercial themes. The team also plans to continue its presence on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have no plans to stop releasing themes into the .org directory,&#8221; Muscat said. &#8220;We just believe this makes an even nicer, more integrated experience for accessing the themes we offer on the WordPress.com side of things.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jetpack&#8217;s announcement has also reignited fears of what the plugin&#8217;s commercialization might do to the WordPress ecosystem. In the past, Mullenweg has <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-powers-42-of-all-online-stores\" target=\"_blank\">identified both Jetpack and WooCommerce as &#8220;multi-billion dollar opportunities&#8221;</a> that could each individually be larger than WordPress.com. If WordPress.org is failing to attract new users with its theme previews, then Jetpack/WordPress.com is likely to pull even more eyes away with its separate marketplace.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a small business (a label that&#8217;s critical) product creator, I see this as a motion in the direction to increase the visibility of Jetpack&#8217;s free/paid feature set, above the rest of us trying to desperately make a living out here,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;Jetpack will be marketed as the one-stop-solution for all of your small business website needs, if that hasn&#8217;t already been woven into the fabric of it&#8217;s current messaging. It is ultimately positioning itself as the trusted source of functionality for new users, versus us &#8216;third-party&#8217; plugins. After all, who wouldn&#8217;t trust the company &#8216;behind WordPress?\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ionut Neagu, CEO at <a href=\"https://themeisle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Themeisle.com</a>, and the author of Zerif Lite, shares Medeiros&#8217; concerns about Jetpack&#8217;s more recent commercialization efforts.</p>\n<p>“What worries me more is the speed at which Automattic is pushing Jetpack,&#8221; Neagu said. &#8220;The Personal plan was introduced, and yesterday I got a cold email from some company they work with promoting their affiliate program. Today themes were introduced. It makes me wonder how far they plan to go and how this will affect theme and plugin developers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, Neagu takes a more optimistic stance on self-hosted users installing themes from WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a theme author, I am not that worried about this particular aspect. Right now those themes are quite hard to find (it took me 10 minutes), are more targeted towards people using Jetpack Manage, and as far as I can see lots of them are looking a bit outdated.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Neagu sees a disconnect between what WordPress.org thinks users want and what they are actually looking for. Based on his research and experience selling themes, Neagu has found that users still expect complete solutions from themes. WordPress has grown beyond being just a blogging platform. Neagu said he hopes WordPress.org&#8217;s research for the new editor will reveal how many people are actually using the software for business.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We run a themes directory as well and we did extensive heatmaps to understand what kind of themes/screenshots users click on/ like,&#8221; Neagu said. &#8220;Looking at the results of a &#8216;business&#8217; query, I am quite sure that users won’t be excited.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/business-themes.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This is likely the first iteration, and data from more Jetpack users should help WordPress.com refine the queries to present a mix of newer and popular themes. At the moment it looks to be simply a way to offer all of their available themes without the red tape of WordPress.org.</p>\n<h3>Automattic Addresses Confusion Over WordPress.org Plugin Directory Guideline Regarding Executable Code and Installs</h3>\n<p>The news of WordPress.com installing and updating themes for Jetpack users gave rise to speculation about whether or not this move is a violation of the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin directory guidelines</a>. Discussions centered around guideline #8, which states that plugins may not send executable code via third-party systems:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Serving updates or otherwise installing plugins, themes, or add-ons from servers other than WordPress.org’s.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jetpack representative Richard Muscat gave us the following statement on behalf of Automattic:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The guidelines prohibit _plugins_ from installing third party code directly but Jetpack doesn’t do that for this feature. The guidelines state that: “Executing outside code within a plugin *when not acting as a service* is not allowed.”</p>\n<p>The service Jetpack provides with respect to themes is via WordPress.com which _is_ acting as a service. This is identical to how Akismet operates with respect to spam-filtering and other Jetpack services such as data sync and backup, content delivery (Photon), and plugin installation/updates.</p>\n<p>We ask users to opt-in to WordPress.com services when connecting Jetpack and all our services follow established guidelines.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The public discussions also prompted WordPress.org Plugin Directory representatives to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/03/16/clarification-of-guideline-8-executable-code-and-installs/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> an article clarifying that Jetpack is not in violation for installing themes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The trick here, and this is what is about to sound like hair splitting, is that it’s not the plugin UI on your site that does the install,&#8221; Mika Epstein said. &#8220;In order for Manage WP and Jetpack to work, you have to go to your panel on their sites and install the items.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As SaaS products have not yet been used extensively in the WordPress ecosystem, developers are still figuring out how this type of implementation can interact with WordPress sites via plugins installed from the official directory. The plugin team clarified that if you are pushing plugin or theme installs or updates from a third-party service on its website, then it is no longer a third-party service but rather a first-party service where you are directly initiating those actions.</p>\n<p>However, not all developers agree that this distinction makes any difference.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/daljo628\">@daljo628</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheJeffMatson\">@thejeffmatson</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/williamsba\">@williamsba</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chriswallace\">@chriswallace</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattmedeiros\">@mattmedeiros</a> Saying SaaS can install plugins but plugin cannot install plugins is silly.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Carl Hancock <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f680.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@carlhancock) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/842485294863712256\">March 16, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gravity Forms founder Carl Hancock contends that ManageWP is different in that it doesn&#8217;t provide users with themes and plugins &#8211; it&#8217;s just a service for managing your sites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can install plugins from the WordPress.org plugin and theme repository, you can connect your Dropbox account and install plugins from your Dropbox account, or you can upload your own plugins,&#8221; Hancock said. &#8220;The key is it’s either plugins and themes from WordPress.org OR bring your own. Just like WordPress itself.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They [ManageWP] do not provide an alternative repository of themes and/or plugins that competes with the WordPress.org repos.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is where much of the controversy lies for WordPress.org theme authors who depend on the official directory for distribution. Competing with equally free themes that are hosted on WordPress.com with a much better sorting UI and preview functionality is a new challenge they will have to embrace.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 00:08:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:123:\"WPTavern: U.S. Department of Defense Launches Code.mil Open Source Initiative, First Release Tests Impact of AGPL Licensing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67451\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:132:\"https://wptavern.com/u-s-department-of-defense-launches-code-mil-open-source-initiative-first-release-tests-impact-of-agpl-licensing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7190:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/department-of-defense.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>A U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle aircraft flies over northern Iraq Sept. 23, 2014, after conducting airstrikes in Syria. &#8211; photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/39955793@N07/15172530147/\">U.S. Department of Defense</a>\n<p>The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/1092364/dod-announces-the-launch-of-codemil-an-experiment-in-open-source\" target=\"_blank\">experimenting with open sourcing more of its code</a> on GitHub. <a href=\"http://Code.mil\" target=\"_blank\">Code.mil</a> invites developers from around the world to collaborate with federal employees on unclassified code. The Defense Digital Service (DDS), which brings in experts from top technology companies like Google, Amazon, and Netflix for short assignments, is organizing the initiative to open source more government code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Open source and free software (which refers to software freedom, not free of cost) are industry best practices and integral parts of modern software development,&#8221; the department said in a <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/1092364/dod-announces-the-launch-of-codemil-an-experiment-in-open-source\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> announcing the initiative. &#8220;They, however, are concepts yet to be widely adopted within the department. With Code.mil, DoD can access a depth and breadth of technical skill previously underutilized while offering software tools created by the government for free public use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The FAQ document for the initiative states that &#8220;modern software is open sourced software&#8221; and that the department is aiming to more actively participate in the open source and free software communities.</p>\n<p>Licensing is one of the unique challenges of making government code open source, as code written by federal employees is not protected by copyright under U.S. laws. After consulting the Open Source Initiative and Free Software Foundation, the DoD devised an open source licensing strategy where code written by federal employees will fall under the public domain with no restrictions. DDS developed a GitHub webhook to ensure commits from government employees follow the <a href=\"https://developercertificate.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Developer Certificate of Origin</a> process. Private sector contributions will be protected by standard OSS licenses. This is outlined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/deptofdefense/code.mil/blob/master/Proposal/INTENT.md\" target=\"_blank\">INTENT.md</a> document on the Code.mil repository.</p>\n<h3>Code.mil&#8217;s First Open Source Project Released Under AGPL to &#8220;Test GPL as an Approach&#8221;</h3>\n<p>In addressing one person&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/deptofdefense/code.mil/issues/19#issuecomment-282333798\" target=\"_blank\">feedback</a> advocating for all Code.mil projects to be MIT-licensed, DDS engineer Tom Bereknyei confirmed that the team will leave this decision to each project&#8217;s leadership.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had these same discussions internally,&#8221; Bereknyei said. &#8220;We did not want to endorse a particular license and we intend each project to decide which license is appropriate for them. Some may choose MIT, BSD, Apache, or eventually GPL. We did not want to take that choice away from them.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/deptofdefense/eMCM\" target=\"_blank\">eMCM</a>, a web-based viewer for the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), is the first open source project to be released on Code.mil. It provides a canonical &#8220;live&#8221; edition of the manual that is easier to access and maintain than previous versions. eMCM was released this week under the AGPL license.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We chose to use the Affero General Public License (AGPL) for the eMCM because every military member has the right to know how the raw legal code (i.e., MCM) will be transformed or manipulated by the eMCM,&#8221; the Defense Digital Service stated in the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@DefenseDigitalService/code-mil-an-open-source-initiative-at-the-pentagon-5ae4986b79bc#.f9bw1s2ha\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>. &#8220;Applying the AGPL is a small but important way to help ensure the public has that freedom and transparency to the process.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the pull-request for <a href=\"https://github.com/deptofdefense/eMCM/pull/5\" target=\"_blank\">updating the license on the project</a>, Bereknyei explained why he proposed the AGPL:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a user-facing project, not a library. Ultimately it would be good to preserve the rights of the public to inspect how the raw MCM is transformed by the viewer.</p>\n<p>Among the projects we have, this seems to be the best candidate for a GPL test. It is fairly self contained, doesn&#8217;t integrate with any systems, front-end heavy, small enough that a corporate rewrite is easy, and uses only a few libraries. My goal is only to test GPL as an approach. If this project isn&#8217;t suited, I&#8217;m sure we can find another.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When Bereknyei was questioned by DDS colleague Nicholas Small about why he opted for AGPL over MIT, he said he wanted to protect the code from being redistributed as closed-source.</p>\n<p>&#8220;MIT would allow someone to fork, improve, and release closed-source,&#8221; Bereknyei said. &#8220;The rule of thumb I am trying to apply is that when the rights/convenience for developers are more important, go with MIT/BSD/ISC. When the rights/convenience for users are more important, go with GPL.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Historically, the DoD has <a href=\"http://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Software-FAQ/#Q:_When_a_DoD_contractor_is_developing_a_new_system.2Fsoftware_as_a_deliverable_in_a_typical_DoD_contract.2C_is_it_possible_to_use_existing_software_licensed_using_the_GNU_General_Public_License_.28GPL.29.3F_Can_the_DoD_used_GPL-licensed_software.3F\" target=\"_blank\">used GPL-licensed software extensively</a> and even <a href=\"http://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Software-FAQ/#Q:_What_license_should_the_government_or_contractor_choose.2Fselect_when_releasing_open_source_software.3F\" target=\"_blank\">recommends government contractors select a GPL-compatible license</a> when developing software as a deliverable in DoD contracts.</p>\n<p>One beneficial byproduct of the DoD&#8217;s initiative to open source more code is that the public can watch and participate as federal employees discuss license selection in the open. The department is finally recognizing that taxpayer-funded code is a public good and inviting private sector professionals to the table to build modern software together. Anyone can open an issue or pull request, regardless of their background, location, or formal qualifications.
